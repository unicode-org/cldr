# Contributing to CLDR

## Overview

The CLDR project consists of 3 aspects:

1. **Data:** We rely on contributions by native language speakers that are most commonly used currently in the given country/region. Most data is collected through the Survey Tool. See [How to contribute][].
    - If you are not a native language speaker, but have evidence of CLDR data being incorrect, file a [Jira][] ticket to report the issue.
    - For data that is not collected in the [Survey Tool], such as [supplemental data][], file a [Jira][] ticket and provide evidence for changing the data.
2. **Internationalization structure:** Requires a ticket to be changed.
    - For structural issues, note that many issues may be due to misunderstandings of the LDML spec. For example, `<pattern>¤#,##0.00</pattern>` has a specialized format where each character represents a special function.
    - File a [Jira][] ticket and provide evidence for the spec issues or to establish a new structure.
    - If your organization is not a [Unicode member][], consider becoming a member and work as a CLDR technical committee member.
3. **CLDR internal tooling** such as adding new tests or fixing tooling that enable CLDR builds and releases. See [CLDR Developer][] introduction.
    - To contribute in internal tooling, [Contact][] us.
    - See [Tools source][] and [Repository Organization][]

### Areas where contributions are welcome

- `cldr-apps/`: (Survey Tool).
    Improvements here include:
  - UI:  performance improvements, visual and functional refinements
  - Additional checks (CheckCLDR) to validate CLDR data.
- `java/`: The core CLDR tooling.
    Improvements could include:
  - better documentation around code components
  - updates to use newer/different library dependencies
  - writing unit tests to improve code coverage
  - better documentation around command line tools

## Requirements for merged PRs

For all PRs these steps are required before the PR is merged:

- The PR and commits must reference a [Jira][] ticket which has been accepted by the CLDR-TC. Open a ticket if there is not already a relevant one open.
- The CLA must be signed, agreeing to the [Terms of use][]. You will be prompted on the PR to sign this if you have not already done so.
- All tests must pass (See below)
- The PR must be reviewed by a TC member.
- The PR should have a single commit, and the first line of the commit must
begin with the accepted Jira ticket number.

### Sample commit message

    CLDR-0000 Brief Description of Change

    Optionally, this is the first line of an extended description,
    after the blank line.
    - Here is an item
    - Here is another item

### Licenses

- Usage of CLDR data and software is governed by the Unicode [Terms of use][] a copy of which is included as [unicode-license.txt][]
- Some CLDR tools depend on libraries in tools/cldr-code/libs/; use of these libraries is governed by separate license agreements.
  - For example, use of the Guava, Xerces, and Myanmar Tools libraries is subject to the Apache License included as [apache-license.txt](./apache-license.txt)
- Use of the ICU libraries is subject to the ICU License, included as [ICU-LICENSE](./ICU-LICENSE).
- There must be a signed CLA before code is contributed, the PR will not be merged until the CLA is signed.

## Building

For setup details, see [Maven Setup][].
Builds are done with Maven:

```
mvn test --file=tools/pom.xml
```

## Tests

For more detail, and how to run the tests locally, see [Running Tests][] on the CLDR development site.

### Automatic Test Runs

Tests are automatically run once a commit is pushed to GitHub and when a PR is opened requesting changes to CLDR. You will see the status check next to each commit's hash, it will show as a circle, x, or checkmark. (●✖✔). For GitHub documentation, see [About Status Checks][]. You can click on these indicators anywhere they appear for more details.

Briefly:

- ● An orange circle indicates that information is not available yet, such as a test that is still running or has not started yet.
- ✖ A red X indicates a failure or a warning. Depending on the type of issue, merging might be blocked.
- ✔ A green checkmark indicates success.

![Commit Checks](./docs/img/commit-checks.png)

Similarly, in a PR, certain checks are marked as “Required.” All required checks must succeed before merging is allowed.

If a test or status check does not pass, see [Running Tests][] on the CLDR development site.
