					The following tailoring is an adjustment of the DUCET collation
					order for ANUSVARA, CANDRABINDU, and VISARGA. Instead of being
					sorted with secondary weights, they are collated on primary level
					before the independent vowels. CANDRABINDU is secondary different
					from ANUSVARA. This gives a sort order very close to the referenced
					dictionaries. The sort order in the dictionaries, which by the way
					are not exactly the same, require quite extensive tailoring.
