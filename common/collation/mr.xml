# The following tailoring is an adjustment of the
# DUCET collation order for ANUSVARA, CANDRABINDU,
# and VISARGA. Instead of being sorted with secondary
# weights, they are collated on primary level before
# the independent vowels. CANDRABINDU is secondary
# different from ANUSVARA. This gives a sort order
# similar to Hindi.
