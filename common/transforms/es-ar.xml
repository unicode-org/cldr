# In Ararbic transcription of Spanish, un-stressed [e] should be treated
# like [ə] which gets stripped off.  However, we currently do have not
# have a good way of finding stress in Spanish words.  In the long term,
# it would be _much_ better to look at stress markers, but for now
# we do this trivial heuristics to find unstressed [e] in the first
# syllable.
