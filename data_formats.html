<h1 align="center">Data Formats</h1>
<p>This document provides basic information about data formats for fields in the
Common Locale Data Repository. It is intended to clarify the meaning of some of
the data in the CLDR for localizers and other people reading the CLDR comparison
charts.</p>
<p>The formats are described in the LDML <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm">specification</a>;
in addition, there is a link at the top of the page to the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/lx">ICU
locale explorer</a>, where the results of different formats can be viewed. Note
that some fields are expected to be in English, since they indicate internal IDs
and <i>not</i> translated text, such as the layout orientation, which has the
value &quot;top-to-bottom&quot;.</p>
<p>This document is fairly rough at this point, and needs quite a bit of work.
However, we felt it worth posting to help answer common questions about the
format.</p>
<h2><a name="Collation">Collation</a> (Sorting Sequence)</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The exact collation sequence for a given language may be difficult to
  determine. The base ordering of characters can be fairly straightforward, but
  there are quite a few other complications involved. For more information, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Introduction">UTS
  #10: Unicode Collation Algorithm</a> (UCA).</p>
  <p>For readability, the rules are presented here in Java/ICU rule format,
  rather than XML. The rules are gathered programmatically; dathering the data
  for the rules is complicated by a number of factors, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Different data sources use a different &quot;base&quot; for tailoring
      (the Common rules use the UCA as a base).</li>
    <li>Sometimes special features are handled programmatically, such as having
      an SHADDA mark apply to all Unicode characters instead of just Arabic
      letters.</li>
    <li>Sometimes characters out of the repertoire are simply ignored, thus
      having a<font size="3">&#380; &lt; ab, since &#380; (z with over-dot) is
      ignored.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Sometimes orderings will not abide by the UCA well-formedness
      critera, so there may be cases where for characters X and Y, X &lt; Y, XY
      and YX are not contractions, but XY = YX.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p>At the moment there are a number of known problems with the gathering
  mechanism that may result in spurious rules. For more information, see <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/locale-bugs/public?findid=18">known
  errors and omissions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Regions, Languages, Scripts, Currency Names</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>These items are perhaps the simplest to translate. The typically behavior
  if any particular one is not available is to display the corresponding ISO
  code (or RFC 3066 code). Thus if there is no localization of FR (France), then
  the string &quot;FR&quot; will appear.</p>
  <p>For a list of the kinds of IDs that can be localized, see the <a href="all_diff_xml/en_US.html">English-US
  locale data</a>, which has most regions, languages, scripts and currency names
  translated. For the possible timezone IDs that can be translated, see <a href="olson_ids.txt">Olson
  IDs</a>.</p>
  <p>Because these lists are long, it may be more difficult to collect all the
  data at once. If that is the case, we suggest first providing translations of
  at least the elements that are most familiar to people with the target
  language. This might be, for example, the countries, languages, scripts, and
  (modern) currencies for:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Countries having the target language as an official language</li>
    <li>G7 + BRIC countries: US, Canada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy;
      Brazil, Russia, India, China</li>
    <li>Countries adjacent to the countries in #1</li>
  </ol>

<h2><a name="NumberPatterns">Number Patterns</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Patterns for formatting different types of numbers. For example, here are
  some patterns (using the US symbols) with the corresponding text.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>decimalFormats</b>
  <dd>The normal locale specific way to write a base 10 number.
  <dt><b>currencyFormats</b>
  <dd>Use \u00A4 where the local currency symbol should be. Doubling the
    currency symbol (\u00A4\u00A4) will output the international currency symbol
    (a 3-letter code).

<dl>
  <dt><b>decimal</b>
  <dd>- separates the integer and fractional part of the number.
  <dt><b>group</b>
  <dd>- groups (for example) units of thousands: 10^6 = 1,000,000. The grouping
    separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some countries for
    ten-thousands. The interval is a constant number of digits between the
    grouping characters, such as 100,000,000 or 1,0000,0000. If you supply a
    pattern with multiple grouping characters, the interval between the last one
    and the end of the integer is the one that is used. So
    &quot;#,##,###,####&quot; == &quot;######,####&quot; ==
    &quot;##,####,####&quot;.
  <dt><b>list</b>
  <dd>- separates lists of numbers
  <dt><b>percentSign</b>
  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a percentage (1/100th) amount. (If present, the
    value is also multiplied by 100 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 123%)
  <dt><b>nativeZeroDigit</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate a digit in the pattern, or zero if that place
    would otherwise be empty. For example, with the digit of '0', the pattern
    &quot;000&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as &quot;034&quot;, but the
    pattern &quot;0&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as just &quot;34&quot;. As
    well, the digits 1-9 are expected to follow the code point of this specified
    0 value.
  <dt><b>patternDigit</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate any digit value, typically #. When that digit is
    zero, then it is not shown.
  <dt><b>minusSign</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.
  <dt><b>plusSign</b>
  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.
  <dt><b>exponential</b>
  <dd>- Symbol separating the mantissa and exponent values.
  <dt><b>perMille</b>
  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a per-mille (1/1000th) amount. (If present, the
    value is also multiplied by 1000 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 1230
    [1/000])
  <dt><b>infinity</b>
  <dd>- The infinity sign. Corresponds to the IEEE infinity bit pattern.
  <dt><b>nan - Not a number</b>
  <dd>- The NaN sign. Corresponds to the IEEE NaN bit pattern.</dd>

</blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Currency Symbol</b>
  <dd>This is used whenever a 'currency symbol' (\u00A4) is encountered in a
    currency number pattern.
  <dt><b>Int'l Currency Symbol</b>
  <dd>Three-letter international code for a currency. Used where a doubled
    currency symbol (\u00A4 \u00A4) is encountered in a number pattern.
  <dt><b>Currency separator</b>
  <dd>This is used as the decimal separator in currency formatting/parsing,
    instead of the DecimalSeparator from the <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a>
    list.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="DateTimeElements">Date &amp; Time Options</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt><b>First day of the week</b>
  <dd>A number indicating which day of the week is considered the 'first' day,
    for calendar purposes. It is 1-based, with 1 being Sunday, 2 being Monday,
    .. 7 being Saturday.
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><b>Minimal Days in First Week</b></dt>
  <dd>Minimal days required in the first week of a month or year. For example,
    if the first week is defined as one that contains the first day of the first
    month of a year, this value will be 1. If it must be a full seven days
    before it counts as the first week, then the value would be 7.</dd>

</blockquote>
<h2><a name="localPatternChars">Localized Date Pattern Chars</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>These characters are replaced with the appropriate values when a date or
  time is being formatted.</p>
  <p>Characters may be used multiple times. For example, if y is used for the
  year, 'yy' might produce '99', whereas 'yyyy' produces '1999'. For most
  numerical characters, the number of characters specifies the field width. For
  example, if h is the hour, 'h' might produce '5', but 'hh' produces '05'. For
  some characters, the count specifies whether an abbreviated or full form
  should be used.</p>

<h3>AM / PM</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even for countries where the customary date format only has a 24 hour
  format, both the am and pm localized strings must be present and must be
  distinct from one another. Note that as long as the 24 hour format is used,
  these strings will normally never be used; but for testing and unusual
  circumstances they must be present.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Week of Year</h3>
<ul>
  Values calculated for the Week of Year field range from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a
  year is the first week of that year that contains at least the minimum days in
  a week days. Weeks between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
  are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (if needed). For example, January
  1, 1998 was a Thursday. If the first day of the week is MONDAY and the minimum
  days in a week is 4 (these are the values reflecting ISO 8601 and many
  national standards), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
  on January 4, 1998. However, if the first day of the week is SUNDAY, then week
  1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and ends on January 10, 1998. The first
  three days of 1998 are then part of week 53 of 1997.
  <p>Values are similarly calculated for the Week of Month.</p>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Time_Zones">Time Zones</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>A time zone uses the Olson IDs, such as America/Los Angeles. These IDs
  provide not only the information as to the offset from GMT (UTC), but also the
  daylight savings information. Thus, for example, America/Phoenix is distinct
  from America/Denver because they have different daylight savings time
  behavior. There are many cases where there is no modern difference between two
  IDs; they are only distinguished in the past. For example, XXX/YYY and ZZZ/WWW
  are currently the same, but differed in the past.</p>
  <p>Most countries do not span multiple time zones, and may not have localized
  names for particular time zones. In that case, probably the best localizations
  are something of a form like &quot;New York Time&quot;.</p>
  <p>Localized names for time zones. The fields are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display long name for the normal time zone.
    <li>Abbreviation for the normal time zone.
    <li>Display long name for the time zone on summer/daylight savings time.
    <li>Abbreviation for the time zone on summer/daylight savings time.
    <li>A city in the specified time zone.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the comparison charts, the ordering of characters for BIDI languages is
  up to the browser. The ordering may differ from the typical ordering in
  context, so may be helpful to copy the text from the charts and paste into
  typical environments to ensure that the ordering is correct. This is
  especially the case for date, time and number formats.</p>
