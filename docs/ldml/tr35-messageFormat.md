## CLDR Message Format

### Introduction

This specification defines the data model, syntax, processing, and conformance requirements for the next generation of dynamic messages. It is intended for adoption by programming languages and APIs. This will enable the integration of existing internationalization APIs (such as the date and number formats shown above), grammatical matching (such as plurals or genders), as well as user-defined formats and message selectors.

### Status

The Message Format 2.0 Specification has been approved by the CLDR-TC for inclusion in CLDR version 45.
The specification will be included in this page prior to release.
