Generating Charts
Generate
The input for this is the cldr-staging/production file, and the output is in github cldr-staging. (If for the development version, the input is main or the maint branch, but we should change that.)
Make sure the settings and VM arguments are right for where you are in the release:
Start, Mid-release, Prefinal release, or Final release (see below)
Run GenerateAllCharts. The results for each will be in ... cldr-staging/docs/charts/by_type/names.currency.html and so on.
Spot-check for sanity.
Start from the main page (eg cldr-staging/docs/charts/index.html), and click on each of those links.
On each of the subpages, take the first chart on each page, recursively.
Use the "Index" link to go back up (not the back button), and make sure it goes to the right version of the page.
Check into github on cldr-staging
Start Release
Make sure the version  (eg 99) is right in ToolConstants
Make sure the last number (eg 99.0) is in CLDR_VERSIONS
Set DEFAULT_CHART_VERSION = "99";
Add an new folder with that number, such as cldr-staging/docs/charts/99
Create the archive (Creating the Archive) with at least the last release (if you don't have it already)
Use the same VM arguments as Mid-Release
Mid-release
Use the VM arguements
-DCHART_VERSION=99
-DCHART_STATUS=beta // =default, uses trunk, calls it β
Prefinal Release
VM Arguments
-DCHART_VERSION=99
-DCHART_STATUS=trunk (uses trunk, no β. Used at the end of the release, but before the final data is in cldr-archive)
In the printout from delta_summary.txt, there is a listing of the sizes at the top
Something like the following:
# dir file added deleted changed total
TOTAL 30,276 3,601 10,909 2,153,094
Add those new figures to the release page
Final Release
Make sure the settings are:
-DCHART_VERSION=99
-DCHART_STATUS=release (only uses the cldr-archive, no β)
Change the page http://cldr.unicode.org/index/charts to add the new release
Check the redirection links on test-chart-links.
On index.html; open it, and fix the version (eg to 25β => 25)
Modifying the chart programs
The chart programs have grown over time, and need some cleanup. For example, the supplemental charts duplicate code that is now in SupplementalDataInfo.
ShowLanguages.
The messages that they use are in a file util/data/chart_messages.html. The right cell contains the key, which is extracted by lines like:
 PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FormattedFileWriter(index, "Zone \u2192 Tzid", null));
The key will be zone_tzid, in this case.
