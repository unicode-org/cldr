Running CLDR Tools
You will need to include some options to run various programs. Here are some samples, but the directories may vary depending on your configuration.
Standard Gorp
-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
-Xmx3000m
-DCLDR_DIR=${workspace_loc}/cldr
-DOTHER_WORKSPACE=${workspace_loc}/"../Google Drive/workspace/"
-DCLDR_GEN_DIR=${workspace_loc}/"../Google Drive/workspace/Generated/cldr/"
-Dregistry=language-subtag-registry
-DSHOW_FILES
The xmx is to increase memory so that you don't blow up. If you only do a few dozen locales, you don't need to set it that high.
Optional
-f regex // to only check locales matching the regex, like ".*" or "en|fr|de" ...
-DSHOW_FILES // shows files being opened and created
