Transforms
Transforms describe ways of converting text. Most often these are transliterations, converting one script to another, such as:
Source	Transliteration
キャンパス	kyanpasu
Αλφαβητικός Κατάλογος	Alphabētikós Katálogos
биологический	biologicheskij
For those, the name of the language or script is used.
There are a few others that have special purposes, listed below. Note that whatever translation is used, it should be short (a few words at most).
For the specialized acronyms (marked with *):
If your language uses Latin letters, you probably want to leave this alone unless there is a well-known name in your language.
For non-Latin, you should transcribe this into your alphabet, and if the name is not commonly understood, add the English in parentheses, such as "XXX (BGN)" or "XXX (UNGEGN)".
Code	Description
BGN*	Transliterations according to the US BGN.
UNGEGN*	Transliterations according to the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names.
Numeric	Numeric conversions.
Tone	Linguistic tone such as used in Chinese.
