# CLDR Technical Committee

The CLDR Technical Committee is responsible for the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository data repository,
which encompasses:
- the data repostory itself, in XML,
- the specification for the data and structure (LDML)
- the tooling used to gather locale data, test the data and structure, and provide test data for implementations
- additional other formats for the locale data (eg, JSON)
