# CLDR Technical Committee (TC)

The CLDR Technical Committee is responsible for the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository data repository,
which encompasses:
- the data repostory itself, in XML,
- the specification for the data and structure (LDML)
- the tooling used to gather locale data, test the data and structure, and provide test data for implementations
- additional other formats for the locale data (eg, JSON)

For information on the working groups (WGs) under the CLDR Technical Committee, see the subpages in the sidebar.
For the leadership of the TC and WGs, see the listings on [Unicode Technical Group Leadership](https://www.unicode.org/consortium/techcommittees.html).
