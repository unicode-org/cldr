# CLDR Conformance Testing Working Group

The Unicode Conformance Testing Working Group aims to instill confidence in and consistency between implementations of UTS 35 and other Unicode data-backed standards,
including ICU4C, ICU4J, ICU4X, and ECMA-402.

- Project page: https://github.com/unicode-org/conformance
- Dashboard: https://unicode-org.github.io/conformance/

In addition to the development and maintenance of the web-based conformance scorecard,
the Working Group liaises with the other Technical Committees to ensure that:

1. New features have high quality CLDR test data.
2. All libraries have a conformance score for those new features.
3. The latest library versions are reflected in the scorecard.
