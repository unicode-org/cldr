# CLDR Design Working Group

The Design WG is responsible for assessing and investigating issues that require design work. 
This includes issues that affect the ICU-TC and ICU4X TC. 
The results are recommendations to the CLDR-TC (and possibly the ICU-TC and ICU4X TC) for resolution of the issue.
The recommendation may be to close the issue, or to produce design that can meet the goals of the issue.
