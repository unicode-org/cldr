# CLDR Person Name Working Group

The Person Name WG is responsible for the development of recommendations for person name formating structure and data. 
These recommendations, once approved, are incorporated into the CLDR data and tooling, and the LDML specification [Part 8: Person Names](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-personNames.html#Contents).
There is a development version at [Part 8: Person Names (development)](https://cldr-smoke.unicode.org/spec/main/ldml/tr35-personNames.html#Contents).
