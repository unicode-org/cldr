# CLDR: Big Red Switch

The BRS (Big Red Switch) is the checklist of tasks that need to be completed in order to release the next version of CLDR.

For members of the CLDR TC: [Spreadsheet View](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0wohmpmnW369UiTLeTm_UHT7y5mVISretDYM0m289I/edit?gid=169833626#gid=169833626&fvid=271364825)

The checklist can be filtered to see open tasks by going to Data > Change view and selecting the 'Skip/Done/Moot' filter.

TODO: List all major types of tasks with their definitions and link to pages with descriptions.

## Contributor Message

For each release, we add names to the Unicode CLDR Acknowledgments page:

http://cldr.unicode.org/index/acknowledgments.

However, names are not automatically entered there, since some people may not wish to have their names listed. If your name is not there and you would like it to be, please send me your name as it should appear on that page. Your name should be in Latin characters, optionally with names in one or more other scripts in parentheses, such as "Vladimir Weinstein (Владимир Вајнштајн)"

**\-\-\-\- how to send this message: currently a crude process \-\-\-\-**

1. get list of those who contributed through Survey tool (Login as TC, under 'Manage Users', click 'Email Address of Users Who Participated' (shows all users, not just your org)
2. e\-mail that list **on BCC:** the above message with a subject line of "\[CLDR X.Y Contributor Message]", and a request to please keep the subject line intact.
3. Then, the subject line can be used to filter/locate the contributor requests.
