    2. [Eclipse](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/running-survey-tool/building-and-running-the-survey-tool-on-eclipse) (survey tool)

3. [Updating DTDs](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/updating-dtds)
4. [Editing CLDR Spec](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/editing-cldr-spec)
    1. [CLDR: Big Red Switch](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/cldr-big-red-switch) (checklist for release)
5. [Adding a new locale to CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/adding-locales)
    

The subpages listed give more information on internal CLDR development. See also: [Sitemap](https://sites.google.com/site/cldr/system/app/pages/sitemap/hierarchy).

Note: when editing Sites pages it is often useful to clean up HTML in material pasted in from other sources, such as Word or Google Docs. Some useful regexes for that:

\<(font|span|div)\[^>\]+>         <$1>

style="\[^"\]\*"
