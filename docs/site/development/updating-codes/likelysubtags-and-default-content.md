# LikelySubtags and Default Content

1. First make sure that you do [Update Language/Script/Region Subtags](https://cldr.unicode.org/development/updating-codes/update-languagescriptregion-subtags) first
2. Run GenerateMaximalLocales with VM argument ```-DCLDR_DIR``` set to your cldr directory to generate the likely subtag data **AND** the default content locales.
	1. If you are trying to debug, add the VM argument ```-DGenerateMaximalLocalesDebug```
3. Input data:
	1. Data comes from territory/language information in supplemental data.
		1. However, it is supplemented by **LANGUAGE\_OVERRIDES** in GenerateMaximalLocales.java
			1. If there is no territory/language information in supplemental data for a language, add it to **LANGUAGE\_OVERRIDES**.
			2. If the mapping changes when it shouldn't (there are some special cases), add to **LANGUAGE\_OVERRIDES.**
4. Output:
	1. Creates {CLDR\_DIR}/../Generated/cldr/supplemental/likelySubtags.xml and {CLDR\_DIR}/../Generated/cldr/supplemental/supplementalMetadata.xml
	2. Diff with {CLDR\_DIR}/common/supplemental/likelySubtags.xml and {CLDR\_DIR}/common/supplemental/supplementalMetadata.xml
	3. Be very careful to diff everything and check for errors.
		1. Watch especially for backwards incompatible changes; that is, changes rather than just additions.
		2. Look at the above to handle that with **LANGUAGE\_OVERRIDES.**
	4. Run tests, fix input data, and iterate as necessary.
		1. Copy into the svn workspace and commit.
