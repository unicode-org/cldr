## Overview

Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software supporting the world's languages. 
CLDR data is used by all [major software systems](https://cldr.unicode.org/index#TOC-Who-uses-CLDR-) (including all mobile phones) for their software internationalization and localization, adapting software to the conventions of different languages.

The largest changes in this release were the updates to Unicode 16.0, substantial additions of Emoji search keyword data, and ‘upleveling’ the locale coverage.

## [Specification Changes](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35.html)

**TBD**

## Data Changes

### DTD Changes 

1. Added alt='official' to represent cases where an official value differs from the customary value. Currently added for a small number of language names, decimal separators, and grouping separators
**TBD**
2. Added new numbering systems from Unicode 16.0

For a full listing, see [Delta DTDs](https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/46/supplemental/dtd_deltas.html).

### Supplemental Data Changes

1. Currency. New currency code ZWG added — because it was late in the cycle, many locales will just support the code.
**TBD**
2. Timezones.
    1. Changed Kazakhstan to reflect removal of Asia/Almaty
	2. Deprecated timezone ids. Altered the handling of: CST6CDT, EST, EST5EDT, MST7MDT, PST8PDT
3. Units
    1. Added units: portion-per-1e9 (aka per-billion), night (for hotel stays), light (as a prefix for light-second, light-minute, etc.)
	2. Changed preferred wind speed preference for some locales to 	meter-per-second
4. Updated: language IDs, likelySubtags, region gdp and language populations, etc.
   1. Minimization for likelySubtags removes some additional redundant mappings
5. Transforms.
   1. Major update to Han → Latn, reflecting new data in Unicode 16.0
   2. Fixes for Arabic numbers, a Farsi vowel

For a full listing, see [¤¤BCP47 Delta](https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/46/delta/bcp47.html) and [¤¤Supplemental Delta](https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/46/delta/supplemental-data.html)

### [Locale Changes](https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/46/delta/index.html)

1. Major changes to emoji search keywords and short names
    1. Data imported from WhatsApp
	2. Increased the maximum number of search keywords
	3. Revision of many search keywords to break up phrases
2. Major changes to Chinese collation, reflecting new data in Unicode 16.0
3. Other changes
    a. Locales also had smaller improvements agreed to by translators. 
**TBD**

### Collation Data Changes
There are two significant changes to the CLDR root collation (CLDR default sort order).
#### Realigned With DUCET
The [DUCET](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Default_Unicode_Collation_Element_Table) is the Unicode Collation Algorithm default sort order. The [CLDR root collation](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Root_Collation) is a tailoring of the DUCET. These sort orders have differed in the relative order of groups of characters including extenders, currency symbols, and non-decimal-digit numeric characters.

Starting with CLDR 46 and Unicode 16.0, the order of these groups is the same. In both sort orders, non-decimal-digit numeric characters now sort after decimal digits, and the CLDR root collation no longer tailors any currency symbols (making some of them sort like letter sequences, as in the DUCET).

These changes eliminate sort order differences among almost all regular characters between the CLDR root collation and the DUCET. See the [CLDR root collation](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Root_Collation) documentation for details.

#### Improved Han Radical-Stroke Order
CLDR includes [data for sorting Han (CJK) characters in radical-stroke order](tr35-collation.md#File_Format_FractionalUCA_txt). It used to distinguish traditional and simplified forms of radicals on a higher level than sorting by the number of residual strokes. Starting with CLDR 46, the CLDR radical-stroke order matches that of the [Unicode Radical-Stroke Index (large PDF)](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/charts/RSIndex.pdf). [Its sorting algorithm is defined in UAX #38](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/#SortingAlgorithm). Traditional vs. simplified forms of radicals are distinguished on a lower level than the number of residual strokes. This also has an effect on [alphabetic indexes](tr35-collation.md#Collation_Indexes) for radical-stroke sort orders, where only the traditional forms of radicals are now available as index characters.
