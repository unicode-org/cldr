## Overview

Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software supporting the world's languages.
CLDR data is used by all [major software systems](/index#who-uses-cldr)
(including all mobile phones) for their software internationalization and localization,
adapting software to the conventions of different languages.

The most significant changes in this release are:

- TBD

For more details, see below.

### Locale Coverage Status
#### Current Levels

Count | Level | Usage | Examples
-- | -- | -- | --
xx | Modern | Suitable for full UI internationalization | ‚Ä¶
xx | Moderate | Suitable for ‚Äúdocument content‚Äù internationalization, eg. in spreadsheet | ‚Ä¶
xx | Basic | Suitable for locale selection, eg. choice of language on mobile phone | ‚Ä¶

#### Changes

\* Note: Each release, the number of items needed for Modern and Moderate increases. So locales without active contributors may drop down in coverage level.

1. [CLDR-17095] The region-based firstDay value (see weekData) is currently used for several different purposes. In the future, some of these functions will be separated out:
    - The day that should be shown as the first day of the week in a calendar view.
    - The first day of the week (day 1) for weekday numbering.
    - The first day of the week for week-of-year calendar calculations.
