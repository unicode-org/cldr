## Overview

Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software supporting the world's languages.
CLDR data is used by all [major software systems](/index#who-uses-cldr)
(including all mobile phones) for their software internationalization and localization,
adapting software to the conventions of different languages.

The most significant changes in this release are:

- TBD

For more details, see below.

### Locale Coverage Status
#### Current Levels

Count | Level | Usage | Examples
-- | -- | -- | --
xx | Modern | Suitable for full UI internationalization | ‚Ä¶
xx | Moderate | Suitable for ‚Äúdocument content‚Äù internationalization, eg. in spreadsheet | ‚Ä¶
xx | Basic | Suitable for locale selection, eg. choice of language on mobile phone | ‚Ä¶

#### Changes

| ¬± | New Level | Locales |
| -- | -- | -- |
| üìà | Modern | ‚Ä¶ |
| üìà | Moderate | ‚Ä¶ |
| üìà | Basic | ‚Ä¶ |
| üìâ | Basic* | ‚Ä¶ |

\* Note: Each release, the number of items needed for Modern and Moderate increases. So locales without active contributors may drop down in coverage level.

([CLDR-16062](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16062))

### Number Spellout Data Changes

- Number spellout rules are added for Gujarati.
([CLDR-18111](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-18111))
- Number spellout rules are improved for several other languages:
    - Bulgarian: Improve usage of ‚Äò–∏‚Äô (‚Äúand‚Äù). ([CLDR-17818](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-17818))
    - Catalan: ... ([CLDR-15972](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-15972))
    - Dutch: ... ([CLDR-17187](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-17187))
    - Hindi: ... ([CLDR-15278](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-15278))
    - Indonesian: ... ([CLDR-17730](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-17730))
    - Lithuanian: Add all of the grammatical cases, genders and grammatical numbers for cardinals and ordinals (no  pronomial forms, and only the positive degree). ([CLDR-18110](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-18110))
    - Russian: ... ([CLDR-17386](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-17386))
    - Ukrainian: ... ([CLDR-16096](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16096))

### Segmentation Data Changes

- The word break tailorings for `fi` and `sv` are removed to align with recent discussions in the UTC
and recent changes to ICU behavior. ([CLDR-18272](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-18272))

### Transform Data Changes

- A new `Hant-Latn` transform is added, and `Hans-Latn` is added as an alias for the existing `Hani-Latn`
transform. When the Unihan data `kMandarin` field has two values, the first is preferred for a `CN`/`Hans`
context, and is used by the `Hani-Latn`/`Hans-Latn` transform; the second is preferred for a `TW`/`Hant`
context, and is now used by the new `Hant-Latn` transform.
([CLDR-18080](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-18080))

### JSON Data Changes

- TBD

### File Changes

- TBD

### Tooling Changes

- TBD

### Keyboard Changes

- TBD

## Migration

- Number `<symbols>` elements and format elements (`<currencyFormats>`, `<decimalFormats>`, `<percentFormats>`, `<scientificFormats>`)
  should all have a `numberSystem` attribute. In CLDR v48 such elements without a `numberSystem` attribute will be deprecated, and the
  corresponding entries in root will be removed; these were only intended as a long-ago migration aid. See the relevant sections of the
  LDML specification: [Number Symbols](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/dev/tr35-numbers.html#Number_Symbols) and
  [Number Formats](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/dev/tr35-numbers.html#number-formats).

## Known Issues

1. [CLDR-17095] The region-based firstDay value (see weekData) is currently used for several different purposes. In the future, some of these functions will be separated out:
    - The day that should be shown as the first day of the week in a calendar view.
    - The first day of the week (day 1) for weekday numbering.
    - The first day of the week for week-of-year calendar calculations.
