# ALPHA DRAFT

## Overview

Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software supporting the world's languages.
CLDR data is used by all [major software systems](/index#who-uses-cldr)
(including all mobile phones) for their software internationalization and localization,
adapting software to the conventions of different languages.

CLDR 48 was an open submission cycle allowing contributors to supply data for their languages via the CLDR Survey Tool —
data that is widely used to support much of the world’s software.
This data is also a factor in determining which languages are supported on mobile phones and computer operating systems. 

### Changes

The most significant changes in this release are:
- Updates for Unicode 17, including new names and search terms for new emoji, new sort-order, many Hani→Latn transform additions
- Recent or upcoming currency names added (XCG, ZWG)
- Rational number formats added, allowing for formats like 5½.
- `usesMetazone` adds two new attributes `stdOffset` and `dstOffset` so that implementations can use either "vanguard" or "rearguard" TZDB data sources.
- Updates to Unicode 17.0, 
- Further additions to the Message Format 2.0 spec
- This is the first release where the new CLDR Organization process is in place for DDL languages.
As a result, several locales were able to reach higher levels (see below)DDL line to add

For more details, see below.

### Locale Coverage Status
The following shows the coverage levels per language in this version of CLDR.
- The **With Script** column indicates which of the **Count** locales are language-script variants.
    - For example, zh_Hant and zh(_Hans) add two to the **Count**, and one to **With Script**.
- The **Regional Variants** column indicates the number of other regional locales: none are in **Count**.
    - For example, there are 46 locales for French, such as fr, fr_CA, fr_BE, etc., so that adds 46 to the RV column for Modern.

#### Current Levels

Count | With Script | Regional Variants | Level | Usage | Examples
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
104 | 5 | 305 | Modern | Suitable for full UI internationalization | Afrikaans, shqip, አማርኛ, ‫العربية‬, հայերեն, অসমীয়া, azərbaycan
13 | 0 | 1 | Moderate | Suitable for “document content” internationalization, eg. in spreadsheet | Akan, Cebuano, Māori, тоҷикӣ
57 | 10 | 22 | Basic | Suitable for locale selection, eg. choice of language on mobile phone | भोजपुरी, बर’, डोगरी, eʋegbe, Gã, हरियाणवी

#### Changes

| ± | New Level | Locales |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 📈 | Modern | Akan, Bashkir, Chuvash, Kazakh (Arabic), Romansh, Shan, Quechua |
| 📈 | Moderate | Anii, Esperanto |
| 📈 | Basic | Buriat, Piedmontese, Tuvinian, Sicilian |
| 📉 | Basic* | Baluchi (Latin), Kurdish |

\* Note: Two locales dropped in coverage (📉), from Moderate to Basic.
Each release, the number of items needed for Modern and Moderate increases.
So locales without active contributors may drop down in coverage level.

For a full listing, see [Coverage Levels](https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/dev/supplemental/locale_coverage.html)

## Specification Changes

The following are the most significant changes to the specification (LDML).

- **TBD Changes will be added before the beta, on Oct 1.**

There are many more changes that are important to implementations, such as changes to certain identifier syntax and various algorithms.
See the [Modifications section](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/proposed.html#Modifications) of the specification for details.

## Data Changes

### Locale Changes

#### General
- Languages that reached Basic in the last release have their names translated at Modern Coverage in this release
- Compound language names now have "core" and "extension" variants for more uniform formats in menus and lists
   - For example, that allows the Kurdish variants to with a uniform format where more than Kurmanji is displayed.
       - Kashmiri
       - Kurdish (Kurmanji, Latin)
       - Kurdish (Central, Arabic)
       - Kurdish (Southern, Arabic)
       - Kyrgyz
- Many features selectable with locale options now have `scope="core"` names, for better presentation in menus
   - Calendar names, collation names, emoji options, currency formats, hour-cycle options, and so on.
   - Rather than seeing
       - Calendar
           - Buddhist Calendar
           - Chinese Calendar
           - Gregorian Calendar
    - Users can see
        - Calendar
           - Buddhist
           - Chinese
           - Gregorian
- Recent or upcoming currency names were added (XCG, ZWG)
- To match ISO, translations for the region Sark (CQ) was added.
- There are now combination formats for relative times.
    - A combining pattern is used to combine a date with a time, such as “March 20 _at_ 12:30”.
In some languages the use of a relative date such as “tomorrow” or “2 days ago” requires a _different_ combining pattern than for a fixed date like “March 20”.
A new “relative” variant is introduced to allow for those languages.
- Some additional flexible (aka available) date formats were added.
- Many locales had seldom-used short timezone abbreviations (such as EST) removed, or moved to sublocales that use them.
- The currency-number formats for alphaNextToNumber, noCurrency, and compact currency formats are now generated from other data for consistency.
The alphaNextToNumber patterns allow for a space between letter currency symbols and numbers, so "USD 123" vs "$123".
- The tooling made it easier to see when a space was a non-breaking character or not, or thin versions of those. The usage is now more consisent in many locales.
- New emoji for Unicode 17 have added names and search keywords.
- For the Etc/Unknown timezone, the exemplarCity name was changed from “Unknown City” to “Unknown Location”, for clarity.
- Rational number formats were added, allowing for formats like 5½.
- Certain concentration units were reworked, for “parts per million”, “parts per billion”
- Additional units were added for scientific contexts (coulombs, farads, teslas, etc.) and for English systems (fortnights, imperial pints, etc.) However, the English system names were not required for translation.
- Additional guidance on translations was added, leading to refined translations or transcreations.

#### Specific Locales
- Kurdish (Kurmanji) `ku` split from 1 locale `ku_TR` into 5 locales across 2 scripts and 4 countries. ([CLDR-18311][])
  - `ku_Latn_TR`: Kurdish (Kurmanji, Latin alphabet, Turkey) default for Kurdish (Kurmanji) `ku` and `ku_Latn`
  - `ku_Latn_SY`: Kurdish (Kurmanji, Latin alphabet, Syria)
  - `ku_Latn_IQ`: Kurdish (Kurmanji, Latin alphabet, Iraq)
  - `ku_Arab_IQ`: Kurdish (Kurmanji, Arabic writing, Iraq), default for Kurdish (Kurmanji, Arabic writing) `ku_Arab`
  - `ku_Arab_IR`: Kurdish (Kurmanji, Arabic writing, Iran)

For a full listing, see [Delta Data].

### DTD Changes

#### ldml
The explanations of usage are in the [locale](#locale) section.
- `exemplarCharacters` added more `type` values:
   - `numbers-auxiliary` — for number characters that are not 'core' to the language, but sometimes used (like regular auxiliary)
   - `punctuation-auxiliary` — for punctual characters that are not 'core' to the language, but sometimes used (like regular auxiliary)
   - `punctuation-person` — for the limited set of punctuation characters used in person name fields: eg, "Jean-Luc", "MD, Ph.D."
- `dateTimeFormat` added a `relative` `type` value for combining time and date.
- `gmtUnknownFormat` element was added — Indicating that the timezone is unknown (as opposed to absent from the format)
- `language` added more `menu` values: `core` and `extension`
- `type` added a `core` `scope` value
- `numbers` added `rationalFormats` sub-elements: `rationalPattern`, `integerAndRationalPattern` (with an `alt="superSub" variant`), `rationalUsage`
- `rbnf​/rulesetGrouping` added `rbnfRules` sub-element:
    - This “flattens” the rules into a format that is easier for implementations to use directly.

#### supplementalData
- `era` — the range of `code` values nows allows two letters before the first hyphen.
- `languageData` the `territories` attribute [`supplementalData.xml`](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/supplementalData.xml) was deprecated and data using it removed. The definition was unclear, and prone to mis-understanding — the more detailed data is in `territoryInfo`. ([CLDR-5708][])
- `usesMetazone` adds two new attributes `stdOffset` and `dstOffset` so that implementations can use either "vanguard" or "rearguard" TZDB data sources.
- `numberingSystem` — Unicode 17 data was added.

#### ldmlBCP47
- `type` adds a new attibute `region`
- `keyboard3@conformsTo` is updated to allow "48" 

For a full listing, see [Delta DTDs].

### BCP47 Data Changes
- `nu-tols` numbering system for Tolong Siki digits
- One additional zone: 	America/Coyhaique = tz-clcxq
- Seven region attributes for determining regions for timezones
- Three additional aliases

For a full listing, see [BCP47 Delta].

### Supplemental Data Changes

#### Identifiers
- Added aliases/deprecations for languages (dek, mnk, nte)
- Updated to the latest language subtag registry, with various additions and deprecations
- Updated to the ISO currency data, with various additions and deprecations
- Added unit IDs part, part-per-1e6, part-per-1e9, cup-imperial, fluid-ounce-metric, … with conversions
  - deprecated unit IDs permillion, portion, portion-per-1e9, 100-kilometer

#### Language Data
- [language_script.tsv](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/tools/cldr-code/src/main/resources/org/unicode/cldr/util/data/language_script.tsv) updated to include only one "Primary" writing system for languages that used to have multiple options ([CLDR-18114][]). Notable changes are:
  - Panjabi `pa` has the primary  to Gurumukhi `Guru` because widespread usage is in the Gurumukhi script -- while most speakers are in Pakistan `PK`, written usage remains Gurumukhi.
  - Azerbaijani `az` and Northern Kurdish `ku` primarily are used in Latin `Latn`.
  - Chinese languages `zh`, `hak`, and `nan` are matched to Simplified Han writing `Hans` -- except Cantonese `yue`, which is known for a preference in Traditional Han writing `Hant`.
  - Hassiniyya `mey` was missing significant data, it should be associated with the Arabic `Arab` writing system by default, not Latin `Latn`.
- 5 new language distance values are added (for fallback to zh).
- Substantial updates to Language Info: additional languages in countries; revised population values, writing percentages, literacy percentages, and official status values.

#### Likely Subtags
- Many additions: see [Likely Subtags]
- Errors in likely subtags addressed
   - The default language for Belarus `BY` is now Russian `ru`, reflecting modern usage. ([CLDR-14479][])
   - Literary Chinese `lzh` was written in Traditional Han writing `Hant`. ([CLDR-16715][])
- Likely subtags updated because of prior mentioned primary script matches.
  - Northern Kurdish `ku` now matched to Cyrillic writing in the CIS countries. ([CLDR-18114][])
  - Hassiniyya `mey` updated to default to `mey_Arab_DZ` instead of `mey_Latn_SN` ([CLDR-18114][])

#### Calendars, Timezones, Dayperiods
- Many updates and corrections for Metazone data
- Many updates to calendars, including the removal of eras and adjustment to era start dates
- Day periods for kok, scn, hi_Latn

#### Plural Rules
- additions for cv, ie, kok, sgs

#### Currencies
- Updates to the latest ISO currencies

#### Weekdata
- IS changed to firstDay=sun
- ku_SY adding H and hB

For a full listing, see [Supplemental Delta].

### Transforms
- Fixed problem in Gujarati → Latin romanization, with ૰
- Updated to latest Unicode 17 data for Han → Latin, with very many changes.

For a full listing, see [Transforms Delta].

### Number Spellout Data Changes

- The biggest change is to the format, which has been “flattened” for easier use by clients.

### JSON Data Changes

- TBD

|  | testData | personNameTest | ba.txt, blo.txt, cv.txt, kk\_Arab.txt, kok\_Latn.txt, rm.txt, shn.txt |
|  | uca |  | FractionalUCA\_blanked.txt |

### Tooling Changes

- TBD

### Keyboard Changes

- TBD

## Migration

- Number patterns that did not have a specific numberSystem (such as latn or arab) had be deprecated for many releases, and were finally removed.
- **TBD Additional items plus future guidance will be added before the beta, on Oct 1.**


### V48 advance warnings
The following changes are planned for CLDR 48. Please plan accordingly to avoid disruption.

- Any locales that are missing Core data by the end of the CLDR 48 cycle will be removed [CLDR-16004][]
- The default week numbering will change to ISO instead being based on the calendar week starting in CLDR 48 [CLDR-18275][]. The calendar week data will be more clearly targeted at matching usage in displayed month calendars.
- The likely language for Belarus is slated to change to Russian [CLDR-14479][]
- The major components in [supplementalData.xml](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/supplementalData.xml) and [supplementalMetadata.xml](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/supplementalMetadata.xml) files are slated to be organized more logically and moved into separate files.
    - This will make it easier for implementations to filter out data that they don't need, and make internal maintenance easier. This will not affect the data: just which file it is located in. Please plan to update XML and JSON parsers accordingly.
- Additionally, language and territory data in `languageData` and `territoryInfo` data will receive significant updates to improve accuracy and maintainability [CLDR-18087][]

### V49 advance warnings

- There is too much uncertainty in the exact values for pre-Meiji Japanese eras,
and there is feedback that the general practice for exact dates is to use Gregorian for pre-Meiji dates.
These are slated for removal in a future release.
Please add a comment to [CLDR-11400] if you use this data and explain your use case if possible.

## Known Issues

- [CLDR-18219][] `common/subdivisions` data files contained additional values that should not be present.
These will be removed in the future, but note that they may be present in the new [JSON data](#json-data-changes):
  - Non-subdivisions such as `AW`:  Use the region code `AW` instead for translation.
  - Overlong subdivisions such as `fi01`: Use the region code `AX` instead for translation.
