## Overview

Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software supporting the world's languages.
CLDR data is used by all [major software systems](/index#who-uses-cldr)
(including all mobile phones) for their software internationalization and localization,
adapting software to the conventions of different languages.

CLDR 48 was an open submission cycle allowing contributors to supply data for their languages via the CLDR Survey Tool ‚Äî
data that is widely used to support much of the world‚Äôs software.
This data is also a factor in determining which languages are supported on mobile phones and computer operating systems. 

The most significant changes in this release are:

- TBD

For more details, see below.

### Locale Coverage Status
#### Current Levels

Count | Level | Usage | Examples
-- | -- | -- | --
xx | Modern | Suitable for full UI internationalization | ‚Ä¶
xx | Moderate | Suitable for ‚Äúdocument content‚Äù internationalization, eg. in spreadsheet | ‚Ä¶
xx | Basic | Suitable for locale selection, eg. choice of language on mobile phone | ‚Ä¶

#### Changes

| ¬± | New Level | Locales |
| -- | -- | -- |
| üìà | Modern | ‚Ä¶ |
| üìà | Moderate | ‚Ä¶ |
| üìà | Basic | ‚Ä¶ |
| üìâ | Basic* | ‚Ä¶ |

\* Note: Each release, the number of items needed for Modern and Moderate increases. So locales without active contributors may drop down in coverage level.

## [Specification Changes](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/proposed.html)

There are many more changes that are important to implementations, such as changes to certain identifier syntax and various algorithms.
See the [Modifications section](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/proposed.html#Modifications) of the specification for details.

## Known Issues

- [CLDR-18219][] `common/subdivisions` data files contained additional values that should not be present.
These will be removed in the future, but note that they may be present in the new [JSON data](#json-data-changes):
  - Non-subdivisions such as `AW`:  Use the region code `AW` instead for translation.
  - Overlong subdivisions such as `fi01`: Use the region code `AX` instead for translation.
