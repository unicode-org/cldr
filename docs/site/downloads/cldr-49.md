## Overview

Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software supporting the world's languages.
CLDR data is used by all [major software systems](/index#who-uses-cldr)
(including all mobile phones) for their software internationalization and localization,
adapting software to the conventions of different languages.


### Changes

The most significant changes in this release are:

- TBD

For more details, see below.

### Locale Coverage Status

#### Current Levels

Count | Level | Usage | Examples
-- | -- | -- | --
xx | Modern | Suitable for full UI internationalization | ‚Ä¶
xx | Moderate | Suitable for ‚Äúdocument content‚Äù internationalization, eg. in spreadsheet | ‚Ä¶

\* Note: Each release, the number of items needed for Modern and Moderate increases. So locales without active contributors may drop down in coverage level.

### V49 advance warnings

The following changes are planned for CLDR 49. Please plan accordingly to avoid disruption.
- H24 will be deprecated. If it is encountered, it will have H23 behavior. There is no known intentional usage of H24. If you have a current need for H24 instead of H23, please comment on [CLDR-18303][].
- As of CLDR 49, the default week numbering system will change to follow ISO (where weeks are numbered based on Thursday), instead of being based on the start of the calendar week. The calendar week will be more clearly targeted at matching usage in displayed month calendars. [CLDR-18275][]
- The pre-Meiji Japanese eras will be removed: There was too much uncertainty in the exact values
and feedback that the general practice for exact dates is to use Gregorian for pre-Meiji dates.
- The major components in [supplementalData.xml](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/supplementalData.xml) and [supplementalMetadata.xml](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/common/supplemental/supplementalMetadata.xml) files are slated to be organized more logically and moved into separate files.
    - This will make it easier for implementations to filter out data that they don't need, and make internal maintenance easier. This will not affect the data, just which file it is located in. Please plan to update XML and JSON parsers accordingly.

## Known Issues

- ISO 3166-2 subdivision codes for Iran changed in 2020, and there are not yet new equivalent stable codes. See [CLDR-19046][] for more details.
