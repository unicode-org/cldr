# Corrigenda and Errata

The Corrigenda and Errata are found on the corresponding release pages. Issues that can cause significant problems are considered corrigenda, and are listed on the corresponding release page. Problems that do not rise to the level of a corrigendum are considered errata, and are listed on the corresponding release page without being listed here. For example, errata for CLDR 1.9 may be found on [CLDR Release 1.9, Errata](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-1-9-release-note).

At this time, there is only one Corrigendum:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Corrigendum** | **Release** |
| 1 | [CLDR 1.3 Release Note](/index/downloads/cldr-1-3-release-note) |

Each release of CLDR is a stable release and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference by other specifications. Each version, once published, is absolutely stable and will never change. However, implementations may - and are encouraged to - apply fixes for corrigenda and errata to their use of an appropriate version. For example, an implementation may claim conformance to "CLDR 1.3, as amended by Corrigendum 1".
