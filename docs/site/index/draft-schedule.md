# Schedule

Two releases are regularly scheduled each year, currently one in mid-October, and one in mid-March. 
The March release is intended to be less data-intensive, and sometimes involves little or no vetting.

The current release is found at [Current CLDR Dev Version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N6inI5R84UoYlRwuCNPBOAP7ri4q2CmJmh8DC5g-S6c/edit?gid=1680747936#gid=1680747936).
