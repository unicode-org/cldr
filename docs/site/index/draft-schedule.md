# Draft Schedule

1.  We are planning on a different process for the future, with the following changes: A consistent release schedule each year.
2.  Two releases per year: Spring and Fall
3.  Making the survey tool open most of the year.

|  | Q2-Q3 Phase |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apr | Submission |  |  |
| May | Submission |  |  |
| Jun | Vetting |  |  |
| Jul | Resolution |  |  |
| Aug | Production | 15 | Final candidate tagged |
| Sep | Production | 15 | Release |
|  |  | 30 | Survey Tool updated |

|  | Q4-Q1 Phase |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Oct | Submission |  |  |
| Nov | Submission |  |  |
| Dec | Vetting |  |  |
| Jan | Resolution |  |  |
| Feb | Production | 15 | Final candidate tagged |
| Mar | Production | 15 | Release |
|  |  | 30 | Survey Tool updated |


The Spring release is intended to be less data-intensive, with a shorter vetting period because of the December holidays. The 2013 Spring release has just a limited internal data phase, because it needs to be shortened to adjust to the new schedule.

Rather than having the Survey tool unavailable except during the Main Submission and Vetting periods, it would be available most of the year: It would be taken down during the Resolution phase, and occasionally for a week for updates or structural changes before the Main Submission phase. The two important periods for translators would be:

-   Submission: translators are asked to flesh out missing data, and check for consistency.
-   Vetting: translators are asked to review all changed or conflicted values, and reach consensus.
