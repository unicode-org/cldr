# CLDR Survey Tool

## Introduction

CLDR has an online tool to gather data, the Survey Tool. The Survey Tool is usually open once a year to gather data for new structure, and make corrections in previously-released data.

A general overview of the Unicode CLDR project is available at [cldr.unicode.org](https://cldr.unicode.org/). To report issues that cannot be fixed in the Survey Tool see [Requesting Changes](/requesting_changes)

### Guide

An overview of how the Survey Tool works for new and returning contributers: [Survey Tool Guide](/translation/getting-started/guide).

[CLDR Survey Tool: FAQs](faq-and-known-bugs) answers many frequently asked questions about the Survey Tool which are not release specific.

### Accounts

You don't need an account to view data for a particular language.
If you wish to propose changes or additions, you will need an account.

- You can request a guest survey tool account via [Survey Tool Accounts](survey-tool-accounts) to contribute to and existing locale.
- New locales need Core data before you can contribute via the Survey Tool. See [Adding New Locales](/requesting_changes/adding-new-locales) for details on how to provide Core data.

### New Fields and Known issues

To see a summary of any new data items and known issues see the [Information Hub for Linguists](/translation) when the Survey Tool is open for data submission.
