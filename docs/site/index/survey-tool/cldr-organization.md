title: 'CLDR Organization'
---

The most effective way to contribute to CLDR locale data is by means of an authorized CLDR Servey Tool Organization (aka CLDR Organization). 
This provides the ability to have multiple vetters (aka Survey Tool contributors), and manage those vetters independently of the CLDR Technical Committee:
adding adding or locking vetters and tracking vetter progress.
In addition, the vetters in a CLDR Organization get increased voting weight: 4 times the weight of a guest vetter.
Typically a CLDR Organization is limited by the CLDR TC to a fixed set of languages; this is often a single language, but sometimes more than one.

## Expectations

In turn, each CLDR Organization also has the responsibility of managing its vetters, resolving any disputes between _its_ vetters, 
responding to requests from members of the CLDR Technical Committee, 
and working with _other_ CLDR Organizations to resolve any disputes via the Survey Tool forum.
It must agree to use native speakers or people who work with native speakers,
who must agree to follow the guidance provided by the Survey Tool documentation, 
including follow [customary modern use] for the language, 
and work to resolve conflicts within the Organization and between Organizations.

CLDR Organzations may contract with a [language service company]
or another entity such as a community organization to handle their contributions, 
while others use their own staff, or organize volunteers.

## Becoming a CLDR Organization

Each Unicode Member [(Full, Supporting, and Associate)][Unicode Membership Levels] may be automatically recognized as CLDR Organizations,
simply with communication from their primary representative.

Other entities may apply to be recognized as a CLDR Organization.
Examples of such entities are:

- Companies
- Government (national or regional) Agencies / Ministries / Departments
- Accredited Universities / University Departments (or colleges, institutes, )
- Tribal governments
- NGOs

An applicant supplies sufficient information to make clear that they are authorized by the entity to apply in its name, 
and that the entity is a responsible party that commits to the expectations of a CLDR Organization in its contributions.

The form may be filled out here: [Request for CLDR Organization]

We will contact you with any further questions and with the updates on the request.
While we are processing your request, you may continue to use guest accounts.
We can transfer guest accounts into your organization later, preserving all of the voting data.

## Guide for Organization Managers

You will privide us with the email of the person who will be the first Manager for your CLDR Organization.
When their account is set up, that Manager can create other Manager or Vetter accounts â€” See [Managing Users].
