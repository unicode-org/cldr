# CLDR Organization

The most effective way to contribute to CLDR locale data is by means of an authorized CLDR Servey Tool Organization (aka CLDR Organization). 
This provides the ability to have multiple vetters (aka Survey Tool contributors), and manage those vetters independently of the CLDR Technical Committee:
adding adding or locking vetters and tracking vetter progress.
In addition, the vetters in a CLDR Organization get increased voting weight: 4 times the weight of a guest vetter.
Typically a CLDR Organization is limited to a single language; but in certain cases that limitation is raised.

## Expectations
In turn, each CLDR Organization also has the responsibility of managing its vetters, resolving any disputes between _its_ vetters, 
responding to requests from members of the CLDR Technical Committee, 
and working with _other_ CLDR Organizations to resolve any disputes via the Survey Tool forum.
It must agree to use native speakers, who must agree to follow the guidance provided by the Survey Tool documentation, 
including follow [customary modern use](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/definitions) for the language, 
and work to resolve conflicts within the Organization and between Organizations.

CLDR Organzations may contract with a [language service company](https://www.nimdzi.com/nimdzi-100-2025#ranking-of-the-top-100-lsps) for vetters
or authorize another entity (such as a community organization) to handle their contributions, 
while others provide use their own staff, or organize volunteers.

## Becoming a CLDR Organization

Each Unicode Member [(Full, Supporting, and Associate)](https://home.unicode.org/membership/members/) may be automatically recognized as CLDR Organizations,
simply with communication from their primary representative.

Other entities may apply to be recognized as a CLDR Organization.
Examples of such entities are:
- Companies
- Government (national or regional) Agencies / Ministries / Departments
- Accredited Universities / University Departments (or colleges, institutes, )
- Tribal governments
- NGOs

An applicant supplies sufficient information to make clear that they are authorized by the entity to apply in its name, 
and that the entity is a responsible party that commits to the expectations of a CLDR Organization in its contributions.
