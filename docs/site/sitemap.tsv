# CLDR Site Map.
# This is a comment.
# The file is a TSV, tab separated value.
# There must be a single 'index' entry here at the root.
# Every page must be listed.   index/charts means index/charts.md for example.
# If an item has 'sub items' it becomes a directory parent.
# You can comment out lines, but an error will be given at build time if a page is missing.
