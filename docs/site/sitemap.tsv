#	CLDR Site Map
#	The file is a TSV, tab separated value.	Keep 3 tabs, for 4 columns (trailing tabs as needed).
#	Lines starting with # are comments.
#	Every page must be listed that is under:	https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/tree/main/docs/site
#	Don't include the .md suffix.	eg, index/charts means .../docs/site/index/charts.md
#	You can comment out lines, but missing files cause errors.
#	If an item has 'sub items' it becomes a directory parent.
#	There must be a single 'index' entry here at the root.
