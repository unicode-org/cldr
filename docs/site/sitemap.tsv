#	CLDR Site Map		
#	The file is a TSV, tab separated value.	Keep 3 tabs, for 4 columns (trailing tabs as needed).	
#	Lines starting with # are comments.		
#	Every page must be listed that is under:	https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/tree/main/docs/site	
#	Don't include the .md suffix.	eg, index/charts means .../docs/site/index/charts.md	
#	You can comment out lines, but missing files cause errors.		
#	If an item has 'sub items' it becomes a directory parent.		
#	There must be a single 'index' entry here at the root.
