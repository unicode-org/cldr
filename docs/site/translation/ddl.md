Hello!

Thank you for your contributions and work on your language!

This is a landing page to help speakers of [Digitally Disadvantaged Languages (DDL)](/ddl).

Please select one of the subpages.

Also, be sure to review the [Information Hub for Linguists].

## Organizations

... please consider creating a [CLDR Organization] 

### Users

... then you can see [Managing users]...

### If the locale is missing

If you need to add a new locale that isnâ€™t currently assigned to your organization, follow these instructions:

1. Verify the locale is visible in the Survey Tool. If not, fill out the form: [Core Data for New Locales].

2. [File a ticket] requesting to add the locale to your organization's `Locales.txt` file.

3. When the locale is added to the Survey Tool and the Locales.txt file has been added, you can then grant your vetters access to that language. See [Managing users].
