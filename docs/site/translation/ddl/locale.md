title: 'Setting up a new locale'
---

If you need to add a new locale that isnâ€™t currently assigned to your organization, follow these instructions:

1. Verify the locale is visible in the Survey Tool. If not, fill out the form: [Core Data for New Locales].

2. [File a ticket] requesting to add the locale to your organization's `Locales.txt` file.

3. When the locale is added to the Survey Tool and the Locales.txt file has been added, you can then grant your vetters access to that language. See [Managing your Organization].
