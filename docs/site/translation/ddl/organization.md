Please consider filling out our new form to request a CLDR Organization.

> Note: This is a new form, so we’d appreciate feedback on it — you can add comments in the last question.

## Benefits of a CLDR organization

1. Having a CLDR Organization allows you to [manage](/translation/ddl/manage) vetter accounts so multiple users can work together, without needing to request us to update each account.
2. More importantly, your organization can vote at a higher level, which will move your language's data to an approved status. This is not possible with a guest account.

## Fill out the Form

## After filling out the form

We will contact you with any further questions and with the updates on the request.
Note that the Organization process is new. It may take a while for us to set everything up.
While we are processing your request, you may continue to use guest accounts.
We can transfer guest accounts into your organization later, preserving all of the voting data.
