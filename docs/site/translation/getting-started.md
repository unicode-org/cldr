# Getting Started

Before getting started to contribute data in CLDR, and jumping in to using the Survey Tool, it is important that you understand the CLDR process.

1. Understand the basics about the CLDR process and the community-based model and the Technical Committee. Read: [CLDR Process](../../index/process)
2. Read the Getting Started topics on the Information Hub:
    - [Survey Tool Guide](guide)
    - [Survey Tool Stages](survey-tool-phases)
    - [Handling Errors and Warnings](errors-and-warnings)
    - [Handling Logical Group Errors](resolving-errors)
    - [Plurals & Units](plurals)
    - [Review Date & Time](../date-time)
    - [Review Numbers](../number-currency-formats)
    - [Review Zones](../time-zones-and-city-names)
    - [Data stability](data-stability)
    - [Empty cache](empty-cache)

\*If you (individual or your organization) have not established a connection with the CLDR technical committee, start with [Survey Tool Accounts](../../index/survey-tool/survey-tool-accounts).
