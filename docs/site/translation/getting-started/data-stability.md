# Data stability

**Please be mindful of data stability. Data change in the CLDR/Survey Tool will have impact to user experiences on devices and applications.**

Please follow below tips to help with data stability:

1. Carefully review the previously Approved data before suggesting for a change.
    1. When it's clearly incorrect, Add your suggestion and start a forum discussion
    2. Don't change the data when it is already acceptable (even if not optimal)-consider data preference vs. data inaccuracy.  
    3. Bring evidence of a variant being much better and in customary use than the existing Approved data to the Forum discussions and gain consensus to change the Approved value.
