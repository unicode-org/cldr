# Empty Cache

**The Survey Tool depends on Javascript and you may run into issues because of JavaScript on your system being outdated.**

In the Survey tool, when going to pages like the Forum or Dashboard, you may see a Disconnect error. As shown in this example screenshot with the Details expanded.

These errors are typically JavaScript being outdated on your system and clearing cache will resolve the problem.

To clear your cache, follow the steps below (Windows/macOS).

**Windows** (please scroll down for macOS/Safari)

1\. On the page that you are running in to the error, click F12 or open **Developer Tools** from the browser (**Settings > More tools > Developer tools**).

2\. Go to the settings, the ⚙️ icon:
