# Other Patterns

Following are two types of patterns you will also encounter in Numbers

The atLeast pattern is used to indicate a number that falls within a range with a known minimum, which is represented by the placeholder {0}. It is used when an exact number is not required, for example to indicate the number of people who have commented on an article.

The **range** pattern is used to indicate a range of numbers.
