<h1 align="center">CLDR Data Formats</h1>



<p>This document provides basic information about data formats for fields in the Common Locale Data Repository. It is intended to clarify the meaning of some of the data in the

CLDR for localizers and other people reading the CLDR comparison charts.</p>

<p>The formats are described in the LDML <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm">specification</a>; in addition, there is a link at the top of the page to

the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/lx">ICU locale explorer</a>, where the results of different formats can be viewed. Note that some fields are expected to be in

English, since they indicate internal IDs and <i>not</i> translated text, such as the layout orientation, which has the value &quot;top-to-bottom&quot;.</p>

<p>This document is fairly rough at this point, and needs quite a bit of work. However, we felt it worth posting to help answer common questions about the format.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you ever need to convert text from hex format (\uXXXX) to real characters or back, you can do the following:</p>

<ol>

  <li>go to the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/tr">ICU Transform Demo</a></li>

  <li>set <i>Compound 1</i> to <u>NFC</u>, and <i>Compound 2</i> to <u>[:^ascii:] hex</u></li>

  <li>paste what you want to convert into <i>Input</i>, and click <i>Transform</i>.</li>

  <li>this will also give the NFC form of the text, which is preferred.</li>

</ol>

<h2><a name="Collation">Collation</a> (Sorting Sequence)</h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>The exact collation sequence for a given language may be difficult to determine. The base ordering of characters can be fairly straightforward, but there are quite a few other

  complications involved. For more information, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Introduction">UTS #10: Unicode Collation Algorithm</a> (UCA).</p>

  <p>For readability, the rules are presented here in Java/ICU rule format, rather than XML; for the same reason, we prefer the bug reports to also use that format, even though the

  end result will be in XML. For more information, see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Collate_Customization.html">ICU Collation

  Customization</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Comparison Charts</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>In the comparison charts, rules are gathered programmatically; gathering the data for the rules is complicated by a number of factors, including:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Different data sources use a different &quot;base&quot; for tailoring (the Common rules use the UCA as a base).</li>

    <li>Sometimes special features are handled programmatically, such as having an SHADDA mark apply to all Unicode characters instead of just Arabic letters.</li>

    <li>Sometimes characters out of the repertoire are simply ignored, thus having a<font size="3">ż 

    &lt; ab, since ż (z with over-dot) is ignored.</font></li>

    <li><font size="3">Sometimes orderings from other platforms will not abide by the UCA well-formedness criteria, so there may be cases where for characters X and Y:</font>

      <ul>

        <li><font size="3">X &lt; Y</font></li>

        <li><font size="3">XY and YX are not contractions</font></li>

        <li><font size="3">but XY = YX.</font></li>

      </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>At the moment there are a number of known problems with the gathering mechanism that may result in spurious rules. For more information, see <a href="http://www.openi18n.org/locale-bugs/public?findid=18">known

  errors and omissions</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>There are a number of pitfalls with collation, so be careful. In some cases, such as Hungarian or Japanese, the rules can be fairly complicated (of course, reflecting that the

  sorting sequence for those languages is complicated).</p>

  <ol>

    <li><b>Only tailor expected data. </b>We focus on the required collation sequence for a given language with normal data. So we don't include full-width characters for a

      European collation sequence, such as

      <ul>

        <li>... CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; ＣＳＣＳ ...</li>

        <li>...&nbsp; CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; \uFF23\uFF33\uFF23\uFF33 ... (equivalently)</li>

      </ul>

    </li>

    <li><b>Tailor trailing contractions. </b>If a sequence of characters is treated as a unit for collation, it should be entered as a contraction.

      <p>&amp; c &lt; ch</p>

      <p>One might think that sequence like &quot;dz&quot; doesn't require that, since it would always come after &quot;d&quot; followed by any other letter; it is a &quot;trailing

      contraction&quot;. But in unusual cases, that wouldn't be true; if &quot;dz&quot; is a unit sorted as if it were a distinct letter after &quot;d&quot;, one should get the

      ordering &quot;d<font size="3">α&quot; &lt; &quot;dz&quot;. This will only happen if &quot;dz&quot; is 

      a contraction, such as</font></p>

      <p><font size="3">&amp; d &lt; dz</font></li>

    <li><b>Watch out for Expansions.</b> If you have a rule like &amp;cs &lt; d, and &quot;cs&quot; has not occurred in a previous rule as a contraction, then this is automatically

      considered to be the same as &amp;c &lt; d / s; that is, the d <i>expands</i> as if it were a &quot;cs&quot; (actually, primary greater than a &quot;cs&quot;, since we wrote

      &quot;&lt;&quot;). This expansion takes effect until the next primary difference.

      <p>So suppose that &quot;ccs&quot; is to behave as if it were &quot;cscs&quot;, and take case differences into account. You might try to do this with the rules on the left:</p>

      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

        <tr>

          <th width="50%" align="left">Rules (Wrong)</th>

          <th width="50%" align="left">Actual Effect</th>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td width="50%">&amp; C &lt; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CS<br>

            &amp; cscs &lt;&lt;&lt; ccs<br>

            &lt;&lt;&lt; Cscs &lt;&lt;&lt; Ccs<br>

            &lt;&lt;&lt; CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; CCS</td>

          <td width="50%">&amp; C &lt; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CS<br>

            &amp; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; ccs / cs<br>

            &lt;&lt;&lt; Cscs&nbsp; / cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Ccs&nbsp; / cs<br>

            &lt;&lt;&lt; CSCS&nbsp; / cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CCS / cs</td>

        </tr>

      </table>

      <p>But since the <u>CSCS</u> has not been made a contraction in previous rules, this produces an automatic expansion, one that continues through the entire sequence of

      non-primary differences, as shown on the right. This is <i>not</i> what is wanted: each item acts like it expands compared to the previous item. So CCS, for example, will act

      like it expands to CSCScs!</p>

      <p>What you actually want is the following:</p>

      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

        <tr>

          <th width="50%" align="left">Rules (Right)</th>

          <th width="50%" align="left">Actual Effect</th>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td width="50%">&amp; C &lt; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CS<br>

            &amp; cscs &lt;&lt;&lt; ccs<br>

            &amp; Cscs &lt;&lt;&lt; Ccs<br>

            &amp; CSCS &lt;&lt;&lt; CCS</td>

          <td width="50%">&amp; C &lt; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; CS<br>

            &amp; cs &lt;&lt;&lt; ccs / cs<br>

            &amp; Cs &lt;&lt;&lt; Ccs / cs<br>

            &amp; CS &lt;&lt;&lt; CCS / CS</td>

        </tr>

      </table>

      <p>In short, when you have expansions, it is always safer and clearer to express them with separate resets. There are only a few exceptions to this, notably when CJK

      characters are interleaved with Hangul Syllables.</li>

    <li><b>Don't tailor what you don't have to. </b>Example: Maltese was sorting character sequences *before* a base character using the following style:

      <p>&amp; B<br>

      &lt; ċ<br>

      &lt;&lt;&lt;Ċ<br>

      &lt; c<br>

      &lt;&lt;&lt;C</p>

      <p>This works, but is sub-optimal for two reasons.

      <ol>

        <li>it tailors c/C when it doesn't need to be; any extra tailoring generally makes for longer sort keys.</li>

        <li>by tailoring c/C, it puts other those things that are after b/B after c/C instead. See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/collation/">http://www.unicode.org/charts/collation/</a>&nbsp;

          for examples.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>The correct rules should be:</p>

      <p>&amp; [before 1] c &lt; ċ &lt;&lt;&lt; Ċ</p>

      <p>This finds the highest primary (that&#39;s what the 1 is for) character 

      less than c, and uses that as the reset point. For Maltese, the same 

      technique needs to be used for ġ and ż.</li>

  </ol>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Exemplar">Exemplar Characters</a></h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>The exemplar character set contains the commonly used letters for a given modern form of a language, which can be for testing and for determining the appropriate repertoire of

  letters for charset conversion or collation. It is not a complete set of letters used for a language, nor should it be considered to apply to multiple languages in a particular

  country. In general, the test to see whether or not a letter belongs in the set is based on whether it is acceptable in that language to always use spellings that avoid that

  character. For example, the exemplar character set for en (English) is the set [a-z]. This set does not contain the accented letters that are sometimes seen in words like &quot;résumé&quot;

  or &quot;naïve&quot;, because it is acceptable in common practice to spell those words without the accents. The exemplar character set for fr (French), on the other hand, must

  contain those characters: [a-z é è ù ç à â ê î ô û æ œ ë ï ÿ]. </p>

  <p>Punctuation and other symbols should not be included. Sequences of 

  characters that act like a single letter in the language — especially in 

  collation — are included within braces, such as [a-z á é í ó ú ö ü ő ű {cs} {dz} 

  {dzs} {gy} ...]. Where combining marks are used generatively, and apply to a 

  large number of base characters (such as in Indic scripts), the individual 

  combining marks should be included. Where they are used with only a few base 

  characters, the specific combinations should be included. Wherever there is 

  not a precomposed character (e.g. single codepoint) for a given combination, 

  that must be included within braces. For example, to include sequences from 

  the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/where/">Where

  is my Character?</a> page on the Unicode site, one would write: [{ch} {tʰ} 

  {x̣} {ƛ̓} {ą́} {i̇́} {ト゚}], but for French one would just write [a-z é è ù 

  ...]. When in doubt use braces, since it does no harm to included them around 

  single code points: e.g. [a-z {é} {è} {ù} ...].<br>

  <br>

  The exemplar character set for Han characters is composed somewhat differently. It is even harder to draw a clear line for Han characters, since usage is more like a

  frequency curve that slowly trails off to the right in terms of decreasing frequency. So for this case, the exemplar characters simply contain a set of reasonably frequent

  characters for the language, based on presence in character set standards.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>This set is case insensitive; this means it does not need both upper and lower case characters. The ordering of these characters are irrelevant. If the sort order or collation

  order is needed, then please refer to the <a href="#Collation">collation section</a> of this guide.
  </p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Display_Names">Display Names</a>: Languages, Scripts, Territories, Currencies, Time Zones</h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>These items are perhaps the simplest to translate. The typical behavior if any particular one is not available is to display the corresponding ISO code (or RFC 3166 code).

  Thus if there is no localization of FR (France), then the string &quot;FR&quot; will appear.</p>

  <p>For a list of the kinds of IDs that can be localized, see the <a href="diff/main/en_US.html">English-US locale data</a>, which has all territories, languages, scripts and

  currency names that can be translated.</p>

  <p>Because these lists are long, it may be more difficult to collect all the data at once. If that is the case, we suggest first providing translations of at least the elements

  that are most familiar to people with the target language. This might be, for example, the countries, languages, scripts, and (modern) currencies for:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>Countries having the target language as an official language</li>

    <li>G7 + BRIC countries: US, Canada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy; Brazil, Russia, India, China</li>

    <li>Countries adjacent to the countries in #1</li>

  </ol>

</blockquote>

<h3>Languages</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>The language codes are based on <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">ISO-639</a>. The translations for the names of the other languages in the current given

  language should be cased according to how the language name would appear in the middle of a sentence. If the user of this data is going to use the name at the beginning of a

  sentence, the developer (not the translator) will title case the word. For example, English will translate fr to be &quot;French&quot;, but Spanish will translate fr to be

  &quot;francés&quot;. </p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Scripts</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>The script codes are based on <a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso15924/">ISO-15924</a>. A script is the set of characters used to display a language. For example,

  English is written with the Latin script, and the ISO-15924 code for Latin is &quot;Latn&quot;.
  </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>Some language can be written in more than one script. For example, the Serbian language can be written in the Latin or Cyrillic scripts, and Uzbek can be written with Cyrillic,

  Latin or Arabic scripts. </p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Territories</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>The region codes are based on <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/">ISO-3166</a>. These region codes include countries, territories and some other places

  of interest around the world. </p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Currencies</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>The currency codes are based on <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Technical+Information/Publications/_Publications/tig90.xalter">ISO-4217</a>. A similar list can be found <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Portfolio+of+Products+and+Services/Books+Guides/Consumer/th42090.xalter">here</a>.

  There are two things can be translated here. One part is the display currency symbol (e.g. the $ for the US dollar), and the other part is the display name (e.g. the &quot;US

  Dollar&quot; for $). The ISO-4217 code is used as the key for these translations.
  </p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Time Zones</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>A time zone uses the Olson IDs, such as America/Los Angeles. These IDs provide not only the information as to the offset from GMT (UTC), but also the daylight savings

  information. Thus, for example, America/Phoenix is distinct from America/Denver because they have different daylight savings time behavior. There are many cases where there is no

  modern difference between two IDs; they are only distinguished in the past. For example, America/Chicago and America/Indianapolis are currently the same, but differed in the

  past. For the possible timezone IDs that can be translated, see <a href="olson_ids.txt">Olson IDs</a>.</p>

  <p>Most countries do not span multiple time zones, and may not have localized names for particular time zones. In that case, probably the best localizations are something of a

  form like &quot;New York Time&quot;.</p>

  <p>The fields are long and short (abbreviated) versions of:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>generic time zone name, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Time</span></li>

    <li>summer/daylight savings time, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Standard Time</span></li>

    <li>standard time, e.g. <span style="COLOR: blue">Pacific Daylight Time</span></li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Numbers">Numbers</a></h2>

<h3>Number Patterns</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>There are different formats for different types of numbers. For example, here are some patterns (using the unlocalized symbols) with the corresponding text. While the format

  is localized, the <i>characters to specify the format pattern</i> are not localized. That is, the decimal point always is represented by a ".", and the grouping separator (thousands, etc.) is always represented by a ",". </p>

  <p>The <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a> resource affects how these patterns are interpreted in a localized context. Here are some examples, based on the French

  locale. The &quot;.&quot; shows where the decimal point should go. The &quot;,&quot; shows where the thousands separator should go. A &quot;0&quot; indicates zero-padding: if the

  number is too short, a zero (in the locale's numeric set) will go there. A &quot;#&quot; indicates no padding: if the number is too short, nothing goes there. A &quot;¤&quot;

  shows where the currency sign will go. The following illustrates the effects of different patterns for the French locale, with the number &quot;1234.567&quot;</p>

<dl>

  <dt><b>decimal</b>

  <dd>- separates the integer and fractional part of the number.

  <dt><b>group</b>

  <dd>- groups (for example) units of thousands: 10^6 = 1,000,000. The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some countries for ten-thousands. The interval is a

    constant number of digits between the grouping characters, such as 100,000,000 or 1,0000,0000. If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the interval between

    the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is used. So &quot;#,##,###,####&quot; == &quot;######,####&quot; == &quot;##,####,####&quot;.

  <dt><b>list</b>

  <dd>- separates lists of numbers

  <dt><b>percentSign</b>

  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a percentage (1/100th) amount. (If present, the value is also multiplied by 100 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 123%)

  <dt><b>nativeZeroDigit</b>

  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate a digit in the pattern, or zero if that place would otherwise be empty. For example, with the digit of '0', the pattern &quot;000&quot; would format

    &quot;34&quot; as &quot;034&quot;, but the pattern &quot;0&quot; would format &quot;34&quot; as just &quot;34&quot;. As well, the digits 1-9 are expected to follow the code

    point of this specified 0 value.

  <dt><b>patternDigit</b>

  <dd>- Symbol used to indicate any digit value, typically #. When that digit is zero, then it is not shown.

  <dt><b>minusSign</b>

  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.

  <dt><b>plusSign</b>

  <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.

  <dt><b>exponential</b>

  <dd>- Symbol separating the mantissa and exponent values.

  <dt><b>perMille</b>

  <dd>- symbol used to indicate a per-mille (1/1000th) amount. (If present, the value is also multiplied by 1000 before formatting. That way 1.23 =&gt; 1230 [1/000])

  <dt><b>infinity</b>

  <dd>- The infinity sign. Corresponds to the IEEE infinity bit pattern.

  <dt><b>nan - Not a number</b>

  <dd>- The NaN sign. Corresponds to the IEEE NaN bit pattern.</dd>

  <dt><b>currencySeparator</b>

  <dd>This is used as the decimal separator in currency formatting/parsing, instead of the DecimalSeparator from the <a href="#NumberElements">NumberElements</a> list. This item is

  <dt><b>minDays (Minimal Days in First Week)</b></dt>

  <dd>Minimal days required in the first week of a month or year. For example, if the first week is defined as one that contains at least one day, this value will be 1. If it must

    contain a full seven days before it counts as the first week, then the value would be 7.</dd>

<h3><a name="DateTimePatterns">Date &amp; Time Patterns</a></h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>The following are characters used in patterns to show the appropriate formats for a given locale. These characters are replaced with the appropriate values when a date or time

  is being formatted.</p>

  <p>Characters may be used multiple times. For example, if y is used for the year, 'yy' might produce '99', whereas 'yyyy' produces '1999'. For most numerical characters, the

  number of characters specifies the field width. For example, if h is the hour, 'h' might produce '5', but 'hh' produces '05'. For some characters, the count specifies whether an

  abbreviated or full form should be used.</p>

<h3><a name="&lt;localizedPatternChars&gt;">localizedPatternChars</a></h3>

<p>These are characters that can be used when displaying a date pattern to an end user. This can occur, for example, when a spreadsheet allows users to specify date patterns.

Whatever is in the string is substituted one-for-one with the characters &quot;<span class="tx">GyMdkHmsSEDFwWahKzYe&quot;, with the above meanings</span>. Thus, for example, if

&quot;J&quot; is to be used instead of &quot;Y&quot; to mean Year, then the string would be: &quot;<span class="tx">GyMdkHmsSEDFwWahKz<u>J</u>e&quot;.</span></p>

<h3><b>Quoting rules</b></h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>Single quotes, (<b>'</b>), enclose bits of the pattern that should be treated literally. Inside a quoted string, two single quotes ('') are replaced with a single one ('). For

  example: <tt><u>'class of '</u>YYYY<u>' at '</u>h<u>' o''clock'</u></tt> -&gt; <b>class of 1939 at 6 o'clock</b> (Literal strings <u>underlined</u>.)</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>AM / PM</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>Even for countries where the customary date format only has a 24 hour format, both the am and pm localized strings must be present and must be distinct from one another. Note

  that as long as the 24 hour format is used, these strings will normally never be used, but for testing and unusual circumstances they must be present.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Eras</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>There are only two values for an era in a Gregorian calendar, &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;. These values can be translated into other languages, like &quot;a.C.&quot; and

  and &quot;d.C.&quot; for Spanish, but there are no other eras in the Gregorian calendar. Other calendars have a different numbers of eras. Care should be taken when translating

  the era names for a specific calendar.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Week of Year</h3>

<blockquote>

  <p>Values calculated for the Week of Year field range from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a year is the first week of that year that contains at least the minimum days in a week days. Weeks

  between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (if needed). For example, January 1, 1998 was a Thursday. If the first

  day of the week is MONDAY and the minimum days in a week is 4 (these are the values reflecting ISO 8601 and many national standards), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29,

  1997, and ends on January 4, 1998. However, if the first day of the week is SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and ends on January 10, 1998. The first three

  days of 1998 are then part of week 53 of 1997. </p>

  <p>Values are similarly calculated for the Week of Month.</p>

<h2><a name="BIDI">BIDI Ordering</a></h2>

<blockquote>

  <p>In the comparison charts, the ordering of characters for BIDI languages is up to the browser. The ordering may differ from the typical ordering in context, so may be helpful

  to copy the text from the charts and paste into typical environments to ensure that the ordering is correct. This is especially the case for date, time and number formats.</p>
