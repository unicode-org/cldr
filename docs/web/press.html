          <h1>Unicode releases Common Locale Data Repository, Version 1.2</h1>
          <p>Mountain View, CA, November 4, 2004 - The Unicode® Consortium announced today the 
          release of new versions of the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR 1.2) and the Locale 
          Data Markup Language specification (LDML 1.2), providing key building blocks for software 
          to support the world&#39;s languages. This new release contains data for 232 locales, covering 
          72 languages and 108 territories. There are also 63 draft locales in the process of being 
          developed, covering an additional 27 languages and 28 territories.</p>
          <p>To support users in different languages, programs must not only use translated text, 
          but must also be adapted to local conventions. These conventions differ by language or 
          region and include the formatting of numbers, dates, times, and currency values, as well 
          as support for differences in measurement units or text sorting order. Most operating 
          systems and many application programs currently maintain their own repositories of locale 
          data to support these conventions. But such data are often incomplete, idiosyncratic, or 
          gratuitously different from program to program. In the age of the internet, software 
          components must work together seamlessly, without the problems caused by these 
          discrepancies. </p>
          <p>The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) provides a general XML format (LDML) for the 
          exchange of locale information for use in application and system software development, 
          combined with a public repository for a common set of locale data in that format. In this 
          release, there are major additions to the CLDR data, to the LDML specification, and in 
          implementation support.</p>
          <p>The CLDR is continually being enhanced and extended, with version 1.3 expected early in 
          2005. All new data or defect reports for CLDR 1.3 must be submitted no later than the 
          January 15, 2004.</p>
          <p>For more information about the CLDR project, with details about the new features in 
          this release and the languages and territories supported, see
