<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Not long ago, computer systems were like separate worlds, isolated from one
another. The internet and related events have changed all that. A single system
can be built of many different components, hardware and software, all needing to
work together. Many different technologies have been important in bridging the
gaps; in the internationalization arena, Unicode has provided a lingua franca
for communicating textual data. But there remain differences in the locale data
used by different systems.</p>
<p>Common, recommended practice for internationalization is to store and
communicate language-neutral data, and format that data for the client. This
formatting can take place on any of a number of the components in a system; a
server might format data based on the user's locale, or it could be that a
client machine does the formatting. The same goes for parsing data, and
locale-sensitive analysis of data.</p>
<p>But there remain significant differences across systems and applications in
the locale-sensitive data used for such formatting, parsing, and analysis. Many
of those differences are simply gratuitous; all within acceptable limits for
human beings, but resulting in different results. In many other cases there are
outright errors. Whatever the cause, the differences can cause discrepancies to
creep into a heterogeneous system. This is especially serious in the case of
collation (sort-order), where different collation caused not only ordering
differences, but also different results of queries! That is, with a query of
customers with names between &quot;Arnold, James&quot; and &quot;Abbot,
Cosmo&quot;, if different systems have different sort orders, different lists
will be returned.</p>
<p>There are a number of steps that can be taken to improve the situation. The
first is to provide an XML format for locale data interchange. This provides a
common format for systems to interchange data so that they can get the same
results. The second is to gather up locale data from different systems, and
compare that data to find any differences. The third is to provide an online
repository for such data. The fourth is to have an open process for reconciling
differences between the locale data used on different systems and validating the
data, to come up with a useful, common base of locale data.</p>
<p>This document describes one of those pieces, an XML format for the
communication of locale data. With it, for example, collation rules can be
exchanged, allowing two implementations to exchange a specification of
collation. Using the same specification, the two implementations will achieve
the same results in comparing strings.</p>
<h2><a name="Locale">What is a locale?</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into the XML structure, it is helpful to describe the model
behind the structure. People do not have to subscribe to this model to use the
data, but they do need to understand it so that the data can be correctly
translated into whatever model their implementation uses.</p>
<p>The first issue is basic: what is a locale? In this document, a locale is an
id that refers to a set of user preferences that tend to be shared across
significant swathes of the world. Traditionally, the data associated with this
id provides support for formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, and
currencies; for the default units of currency; for measurement units, for
sort-order (collation), plus translated names for timezones, languages,
countries, and scripts. They can also include text boundaries (character, word,
line, and sentence), text transformations (including transliterations), and
support for other services.</p>
<p>Locale data is not cast in stone: the data used on someone's machine
generally may reflect the US format for example, but preferences can typically
set to override particular items, such as setting the data format for
2002.03.15, or using metric vs. Imperial measurement units. In the abstract,
locales are simply one of many sets of preferences that, say, a website may want
to remember for a particular user. Depending on the application, it may want to
also remember the user's timezone, preferred character set, smoker/non-smoker
preference, meal preference (vegetarian, kosher, etc.), music preference,
religion, party affiliation, favorite charity, etc. Users also customize their
preferences.</p>
<p>Locale data in a system may also change over time: country boundaries change;
governments (and currencies) come and go: committees impose new standards; bugs
are found and fixed in the source data; and so on. Thus the data needs to be
versioned for stability over time.</p>
<p>In general terms, the locale id is a parameter that is supplied to a
particular service (date formatting, sorting, spell-checking, etc.). The format
in this document does not attempt to collect together all the data that could
conceivably be used by all possible services. Instead, it collects together data
that is in common use in systems and internationalization libraries for basic
services.</p>
<p>We will speak of data as being &quot;in locale X&quot;. That does not imply
that a locale <i>is</i> a collection of data; it is simply shorthand for
&quot;the set of data associated with the locale id X&quot;. Each individual
piece of data is called a <i>resource</i>, and a tag indicating the key of
resource is called a <i>resource tag.</i></p>
<h2><a name="Locale_IDs">Locale IDs</a></h2>
<p>A locale id consists of the following format:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><i>locale_id</i> := <i>base_locale_id</i> <i>options</i>?</pre>
  <pre><i>base_locale_id</i> := <i>language_code</i>(&quot;_&quot; <i>territory_code </i>(&quot;_&quot; <i>variant_code</i>)?)?</pre>
  <pre><i>options</i> := &quot;@&quot; <i>key</i> &quot;=&quot; <i>type</i> (&quot;,&quot; <i>key</i> &quot;=&quot; <i>type</i> )*</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The field values are given in the following table. All field values are
case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The locale id format generally follows the description in the <a href="http://www.li18nux.org/docs/text/LocNameGuide-V10.txt">OpenI18N
Locale Naming Guideline</a>. The main differences from the those guidelines are
that (a) the locale id does not include a charset (since the data in the locale
is always in Unicode), and (b) the locale id adds the ability to have a variant,
as in Java.</p>
<p>A locale that only has a language code is called a <i>language locale</i>;
one with both language and territory codes is called a <i>territory locale</i>
(or <i>country locale</i>).</p>
<p>The variant codes specify particular variants of the locale, typically with
special options. The currently defined variants include:</p>

<h2><a name="Locale_Inheritance">Locale Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>The XML format relies on an inheritance model, whereby the resources are
collected into <i>bundles</i>, and the bundles organized into a tree. Data for
the many Spanish locales does not need to be duplicated across all of the
countries having Spanish as a national language. Instead, common data is
collected in the Spanish language locale, and territory locales only need to
supply differences. The parent of all of the language locales is a generic
locale known as <i>root</i>. Wherever possible, the resources in the root are
language &amp; territory neutral. For example, the collation order in the root
is the UCA (see UAX #10). Since English language collation has the same
ordering, the 'en' locale data does not need to supply any collation data, nor
does either the 'en_US' or the 'en_IE' locale data.</p>
<p class="ed_note">[Ed. Note: add diagram here]</p>
<p>Given a particular locale id &quot;en_US_someVariant&quot;, the search chain
for a particular resource is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>en_US_someVariant
en_US
en
root</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If a type and key are supplied in the locale id, then logically the chain
from that id to the root is searched for a resource tag with a given type, all
the way up to root. If no resource is found with that tag and type, then the
chain is searched again without the type.</p>
<p>Thus the data for any given locale will only contain resources that are
different from the parent locale. For example, most territory locales will
inherit the bulk of their data from the language locale: &quot;en&quot; will
contain the bulk of the data: &quot;en_US&quot; will only contain a few items
like currency. All data that is inherited from a parent is presumed to be valid,
just as valid as if it were physically present in the file. This provides for
much smaller resource bundles, and much simpler (and less error-prone)
maintenance.</p>
<p>Where this inheritance relationship does not match a target system, such as
POSIX, the data logically should be fully resolved in converting to a format for
use by that system, by adding <i>all</i> inherited data to each locale data set.</p>
<p>The locale data does not contain general character properties that are
derived from the Unicode Character Database data [<a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html">UCD</a>].
That data being common across locales, it is not duplicated in the bundles.
Constructing a POSIX locale from the following data requires use of that data.
In addition, POSIX locales may also specify the character encoding, which
requires the data to be transformed into that target encoding.</p>
<h3><a name="Multiple_Inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</a></h3>
<p>In clearly specified instances, resources may inherit from within the same
locale. For example, currency format symbols inherit from the number format
symbols; the Buddhist calendar inherits from the Gregorian calendar. This <i>only</i>
happens where documented in this specification. In these special cases, the
inheritance within the locale supercedes the inheritance from the parent.</p>
<h2><a name="Data_Access">Data Access</a></h2>
<p>Data can be accessed by means of a URL. A locale URL has the following
structure:</p>
<pre><i>base</i> &quot;/&quot; platform &quot;/&quot; <i>base_locale_id</i> &quot;.xml&quot; (&quot;?&quot; (&quot;version=&quot; <i>version</i> | <i>transformed_options</i>)</pre>
<p>The version is the version of the entire tree, not of a particular resource
bundle, or resource within a bundle. The format for the version depends on the
source of the data. For example, for <i>openoffice.org</i> the current version
(at the time of this writing) would be 1.2, and for <i>icu</i> the current
version at the time of this writing would be 2.2. The transformed options are
the &lt;options&gt; from the <a href="#Locale_IDs">Locale ID</a> with the
&quot;@&quot; removed, and &quot;,&quot; converted to &quot;&amp;&quot;.</p>
<p><i>Example, where base = http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/locale/ and
platform = icu</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/locale/icu/de_DE.xml?version=2.2&amp;collation=phonebook&amp;currency=pre-euro">http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/locale/icu/de_DE.xml?version=2.2&amp;collation=phonebook&amp;currency=pre-euro</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in time, there is not a mechanism for querying the base to
determine which platforms, which versions of each platform, and which locales in
the version are supported. In the future there will be more information,
accessible at <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locale/">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locale/</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="XML_Format">XML Format</a></h2>
<p>The following sections describe the structure of the XML format for locale
data. To start with, the root element is &lt;localeData&gt;. That element
contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#&lt;identity&gt;">&lt;identity&gt;</a></li>
  <li><a href="#&lt;localeDisplayNames&gt;">&lt;localeDisplayNames&gt;</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#&lt;collations&gt;">&lt;collations&gt;</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#&lt;collation&gt;">&lt;collation&gt;</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The structure of each of these elements and their contents will be described
below. The first few elements have little structure, while dates, numbers, and
collations are more involved.</p>
<p>In general, all translatable text in this format is in element contents,
while attributes are reserved for types and non-translated information (such as
numbers or dates). The reason that attributes are not used for translatable text
is that spaces are not preserved, and we cannot predict where spaces may be
significant in translated material.</p>
<p>Note that the data in examples given below is purely illustrative, and
doesn't match any particular language. For a more detailed example of this
format, see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/LocaleElements.xml">Example</a>.
There is also a <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/LocaleElements.dtd">DTD</a>
for this format, but remember that the DTD alone is not sufficient to understand
the semantics, the constraints, nor&nbsp; the interrelationships between the
different elements and attributes. You may wish to have copies of each of these
to hand as you proceed through the rest of this document.</p>
<p class="note">Note: To compare with the ICU locale data format and contents,
see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/icu/source/data/">ICU Data</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Common_Elements">Common Elements</a></h3>
<p>At any level in any element, two special elements are allowed.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;special owner=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>This element is designed to allow for arbitrary additional annotation and
data that is product-specific. It has one required attribute, which specifies
the owner of the special data. For uniqueness, that owner is specified by means
of a URL. For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;special owner=&quot;http://www.opengroup.org/regproducts/xu.htm&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- old abbreviations for pre-GUI days --&gt;
    &lt;messages&gt;
        &lt;no&gt;No&lt;/no&gt;
        &lt;yes&gt;Yes&lt;/yes&gt;
        &lt;shortYes&gt;Y&lt;/shortYes&gt;
        &lt;shortNo&gt;N&lt;/shortNo&gt;
    &lt;/messages&gt;
&lt;/special&gt;</pre>
<p class="element2"><b>&lt;alias source=&quot;&lt;locale_ID&gt;&quot;&gt;</b></p>
<p>The contents of any element can be replaced by an alias, which points to
another source for the data. The resource is to be fetched from the
corresponding location in the other source. Normal resource searching is to be
used; take the following example:</p>
<pre>&lt;localeData&gt;
  &lt;collations&gt;
    &lt;collation type=&quot;phonebook&quot;&gt;
      &lt;alias source=&quot;de_DE&quot; type=&quot;phonebook&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/collation&gt;
  &lt;/collation&gt;
&lt;/localeData&gt;</pre>
<p>The resource bundle at &quot;de_DE&quot; will be searched for a resource
element at the same position in the the same tree with type
&quot;collation&quot;. If not found there, then the resource bundle at
&quot;de&quot; will be searched, etc.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;displayName&gt;</p>
<p>Many elements can have a display name. This is a translated name that can be
presented to users when discussing the particular service. For example, a number
format, used to format numbers using the conventions of that locale, can have
translated name for presentation in GUIs.</p>
<pre>  &lt;numberFormat&gt;
    &lt;displayName&gt;Prozentformat&lt;/displayName&gt;
...
  &lt;numberFormat&gt;</pre>
<p class="element2">&lt;default type=&quot;someID&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>In some cases, a number of elements are present. The default element can be
used to indicate which of them is the default, in the absence of other
information. The value of the type attribute is to match the value of the type
attribute for the selected item.</p>
<pre>&lt;numberFormats&gt;
    &lt;default type=&quot;<font color="#0000FF">scientific</font>&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;numberFormat type=&quot;decimal&quot;&gt;...&lt;/numberFormat&gt;
    &lt;numberFormat type=&quot;percent&quot;&gt;...&lt;/numberFormat&gt;
    &lt;numberFormat type=&quot;<font color="#0000FF">scientific</font>&quot;&gt;...&lt;/numberFormat&gt;
&lt;/numberFormats&gt;</pre>
<p>Like all other elements, the &lt;default&gt; element is inherited. Thus, it
can also refer to inherited resources. For example, suppose that the above
resources are present in fr, and that in fr_BE we have the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;numberFormats&gt;
  &lt;default type=&quot;<font color="#0000FF">decimal</font>&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/numberFormats&gt;</pre>
<p>In that case, the default number format for fr_BE would be the inherited
&quot;decimal&quot; resource from fr. Now suppose that we had in fr_CA:</p>
<pre>&lt;numberFormats&gt;
  &lt;numberFormat type=&quot;<font color="#0000FF">scientific</font>&quot;&gt;...&lt;/numberFormat&gt;
&lt;/numberFormats&gt;</pre>
<p>In this case, the &lt;default&gt; is inherited from fr, and has the value
&quot;scientific&quot;. It thus refers to this new &quot;scientific&quot;
pattern in this resource bundle.</p>
<h3><a name="Common_Attributes">Common Attributes</a></h3>
<p class="element2">&lt;... type=&quot;stroke&quot; ...&gt;</p>
<p>The attribute <i>type</i> is also used to indicate an alternate resource that
can be selected with a matching type=option in the locale id modifiers, or be
referenced by a default element. For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;localeData&gt;
  ...
  &lt;currencies&gt;
    &lt;currency&gt;...&lt;/currency&gt;
    &lt;currency type=&quot;preEuro&quot;&gt;...&lt;/currency&gt;
  &lt;/currencies&gt;
&lt;/localeData&gt;</pre>
<p>If there is no type attribute present, then the value is assumed to be
&quot;standard&quot;.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="&lt;identity&gt;">&lt;identity&gt;</a></h3>
<p>The identity element contains information identifying the target locale for
this data, and general information about the version of this data.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;version number=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>The version element provides, in an attribute, the version of this
file.&nbsp; The contents of the element can contain textual notes about the
changes between this version and the last. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;version number=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;Various notes and changes in version 1.1&lt;/version&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;generation date=&quot;2002-08-28&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The generation element contains the last modified date for the data. The data
is in XML Schema format (yyyy-mm-dd).</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;language type=&quot;en&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The language code is the primary part of the specification of the locale id,
with values as described above.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;territory type=&quot;US&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The territory code is the secondary part of the specification of the locale
id, with values as described above.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;variant type=&quot;BU&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The variant code is the tertiary part of the specification of the locale id,
with values as described above.</p>
<h3><a name="&lt;localeDisplayNames&gt;">&lt;localeDisplayNames&gt;</a></h3>
<p>Display names for scripts, languages, countries, and variants in this locale
are supplied by this element. These supply localized names for these items for
use in user-interfaces for displaying lists of locales and scripts. Examples are
given below:</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;scripts&gt;</p>
<p>This element can contain an number of script elements. Each script element
provides the localized name for a script, given by the value of the type
attribute. The script IDs can be either the long or short forms from Scripts.txt
in the UCD. (See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr24/">UTR #24:
Script Names</a> for more information.) For example, in the language of this
locale, the name for the Latin script might be &quot;Romana&quot;, and for the
Cyrillic script is &quot;Kyrillica&quot;. That would be expressed with the
following.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;script type=&quot;Latin&quot;&gt;Romana&lt;/script&gt;<br>
  &lt;script type=&quot;Cyrillic&quot;&gt;Kyrillica&lt;/script&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;languages&gt;</p>
<p>This contains a list of elements that provide the user-translated names for
language codes from <a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_639.html">ISO-639</a>,
as described in <a href="#Locale_IDs">Locale_IDs</a>.</p>

  &lt;territory type=&quot;US&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/territory&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;variants&gt;</p>
<p>This contains a list of elements that provide the user-translated names for
the <i>variant_code</i> values described in <a href="#Locale_IDs">Locale_IDs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;variant type=&quot;NY&quot;&gt;Nynorsk&lt;/variant&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;keys&gt;</p>
<p>This contains a list of elements that provide the user-translated names for
the <i>key</i> values described in <a href="#Locale_IDs">Locale_IDs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;key type=&quot;collation&quot;&gt;Sortierung&lt;/key&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;types&gt;</p>
<p>This contains a list of elements that provide the user-translated names&nbsp;
for the <i>type</i> values described in <a href="#Locale_IDs">Locale_IDs</a>.
Since the translation of an option name may depend on the <i>key</i> it is used
with, the latter is optionally supplied.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;type type=&quot;phonebook&quot; key=&quot;collation&quot;&gt;Telefonbuch&lt;/type&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="&lt;layout&gt;">&lt;layout&gt;</a></h3>
<p>This top-level element specifies general layout features. It currently only
has one possible element (other than &lt;special&gt;, which is always
permitted).</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;orientation lines=&quot;top-to-bottom&quot;
characters=&quot;left-to-right&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The lines and characters attributes specify the default general ordering of
lines, and characters within a line. The values are:</p>
<table border="1">
  <caption>Orientation Attributes</caption>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" rowspan="2">Vertical</td>
    <td width="50%">top-to-bottom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">bottom-to-top</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" rowspan="2">Horizontal</td>
    <td width="50%">left-to-right</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">right-to-left</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If the lines value is vertical then the characters value must be horizontal,
and vice versa. This does not override the ordering behavior of bidirectional
text; it does, however, supply the paragraph direction for that text (for more
information, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>).</p>
<h3><a name="&lt;encodings&gt;">&lt;encodings&gt;</a></h3>
<p>The encodings element does <i>not</i> (unlike POSIX) specify the encoding of
the data itself. Instead, it provide optional information that can be helpful in
picking among character encodings that are typically used to transmit data in
the language of this locale. It typically only occurs in a language locale, not
in a language/territory locale.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;exemplarCharacters&gt;[a-zåæø]&lt;/exemplarCharacters&gt;</p>
<p>This element indicates that normal usage of the language of this locale
requires these letters. An encoding that cannot encompass at least these letters
is inappropriate for encoding data in the language of this locale. The list of
characters is in <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/unicodeSet.html">UnicodeSet</a>
format, which allows boolean combinations of sets of letters, including those
specified by Unicode properties.</p>
<p>The letters do not necessarily form a complete set (especially for languages
using large character sets, such as CJK). Nor does the list necessarily include
letters that are used in common foreign words used in that language. The letters
are only the lowercase alternatives, but implicitly include the normal
&quot;case-closure&quot;: all uppercase and titlecase variants. For the special
case of Turkish, the dotted capital I should be included. Sequences of
characters that are considered to be a single letter in the alphabet, such as
&quot;ch&quot; can be included, using curly braces (e.g., [[a-z{ch}{ll}{rr}] -
[w]])</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;mapping registry=&quot;iana&quot;
type=&quot;windows-1252&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>There can be multiple mapping elements. Each indicates the character
conversion mapping table name for a character encoding that is commonly used to
encode data in the language of this locale. The version field of the mapping
table is omitted. The ordering among the mapping elements is not significant.
The mapping elements themselves are not inherited from parents.</p>
<p>The registry indicates the source of the encoding. Currently the only
registry that can be used is &quot;iana&quot;, which specifies use of&nbsp; an <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">IANA
name</a>.&nbsp; Note: while IANA names are not precise for conversion (see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/">UTR
#22: Character Mapping Tables</a>), they are sufficient for this purpose.</p>
<h3><a name="&lt;delimiters&gt;">&lt;delimiters&gt;</a></h3>
<p>The delimiters supply common delimiters for bracketing. The values should be
self-explanatory, so only some examples are given:</p>
<pre>&lt;quotationStart&gt;‘&lt;/quotationStart&gt;
&lt;quotationEnd&gt;’&lt;/quotationEnd&gt;
&lt;doubleQuotationStart&gt;“&lt;/doubleQuotationStart&gt;
&lt;doubleQuotationEnd&gt;”&lt;/doubleQuotationEnd&gt;</pre>
<h3><a name="&lt;measurement&gt;">&lt;measurement&gt;</a></h3>
<pre>&lt;measurementSystem type=&quot;US&quot;/&gt;</pre>
<p>The measurement system is the normal measurement system in common everyday
use (except for date/time). The values are &quot;metric&quot; (= <a href="http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=5448&amp;ICS1=1&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=">ISO
1000</a>) or &quot;US&quot;; others will be added over time.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> in the future, we may need to add display names for
the particular measurement units (millimeter vs millimetre vs whatever the
Greek, Russian, etc are), and a message format for position those with respect
to numbers. E.g. &quot;{number} {unitName}&quot; in some languages, but &quot;{unitName}
{number}&quot; in others.</p>
<p>The paperSize element gives the normal business letter size, and customary
units. The units for the numbers are always in millimeters. The units name is
the customary unit for that locale for measuring paper, so to display the
numbers to the users, one would convert from millimeters to the customary units.</p>
<pre>&lt;paperSize&gt;
  &lt;height&gt;279&lt;/height&gt;
  &lt;width&gt;216&lt;/width&gt;
  &lt;units&gt;mm&lt;/units&gt;
&lt;/paperSize&gt;</pre>
<h3><a name="&lt;dates&gt;">&lt;dates&gt;</a></h3>
<p>This top-level element contains information regarding the format and parsing
of dates and times. The data is based on the Java/ICU format. Most of these are
fairly self-explanatory, except <i>minDays</i> and <i>localizedPatternChars</i>.
For information on this, and more information on other elements and attributes,
see the Java API: <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html">DateFormat</a>,

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>there is an on-line demonstration of date
formatting and parsing at <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/lx">Locale
Explorer</a> (pick the locale and scroll to &quot;Date Patterns&quot;).</p>
<p>The &lt;dates&gt; element has three possible sub-elements: &lt;localizedPatternCharacters&gt;,
&lt;calendars&gt; and &lt;timeZoneNames&gt;</p>
<pre class="element2"><a name="&lt;localizedPatternChars&gt;">&lt;localizedPatternChars&gt;</a>GyMdkHmsSEDFwWahKz&lt;/localizedPatternChars&gt;</pre>
<p>The interpretation of this is explained in <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/DateFormatSymbols.html">DateFormatSymbols</a>.</p>
<pre class="element2"><a name="&lt;calendars&gt;">&lt;calendars&gt;</a></pre>
<p>This element contains multiple &lt;calendar&gt; elements, each of which
specifies the fields used for formatting and parsing dates and times according
to the given calendar. The month names are identified numerically, starting at
1. The day names are identified with short strings, since there is no
universally-accepted numeric designation.</p>
<p>Many calendars will only differ from the Gregorian Calendar in the year and
era values. For example, the Japanese calendar will have many more eras (one for
each Emperor), and the years will be numbered within that era. All other
calendars inherit from the Gregorian calendar (which must be present), so only
the differing data will be present.</p>
<p class="example">Example:</p>
<pre>  &lt;calendar class=&quot;gregorian&quot;&gt;

<h3><a name="&lt;numbers&gt;">&lt;numbers&gt;</a></h3>
<p>The numbers element supplies information for formatting and parsing numbers
and currencies. It has three sub-elements: &lt;symbols&gt;, &lt;numbers&gt;, and
&lt;currencies&gt;. The data is based on the Java/ICU format. The currency IDs
are from <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/Technical+Information/Publications/_Publications/tig90x.doc">ISO

<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>The number of decimal places <b>and</b> the

<h3><a name="&lt;collations&gt;">&lt;collations&gt;</a></h3>
<p>This section contains one or more collation elements, distinguished by type.
Each collation contains rules that specify a certain sort-order, as a tailoring
of the UCA table. This syntax is an XMLized version of the Java/ICU syntax.
While a summary of the effect of different rules are given here, the specifics
of the rules are defined by correspondence with the <i>basic</i> <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Collate_Customization.html">ICU
rule syntax</a> (used in ICU and Java) and/or the ICU parameterizations.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>ICU provides a concise format for specifying
orderings, based on tailorings to the UCA. For example, to specify that k and q
follow 'c', one can use the rule: &quot;&amp; c &lt; k &lt; q&quot;. The rules
also allow people to set default general parameter values, such as whether
uppercase is before lowercase or not. (Java contains an earlier version of ICU,
and has not been updated recently. It does not support any of the basic syntax
marked with [...], and its default table is not the UCA.)</p>
<p class="note">However, it is <b>not</b> necessary for ICU to be used in the
underlying implementation. The features are simply described here in terms of
the ICU capabilities, since that is easier than duplicating the text. In a final
version of the specification, the details of the semantics will be copied here.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>there is an on-line demonstration of collation at <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/lx">Locale
Explorer</a> (pick the locale and scroll to &quot;Collation Rules&quot;).</p>
<p>Like the ICU rules, the tailoring syntax is designed to be independent of the
actual weights used in any particular UCA table. That way the same rules can be
applied to UCA versions over time, even if the underlying weights change. The
following describes the overall document structure of a collation:</p>
<p><code><a name="&lt;collation&gt;">&lt;collation&gt;</a><br>
&nbsp;&lt;uca version='3.1.1'&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&lt;settings caseLevel=&quot;on&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&lt;rules&gt;<br>
<font color="#00FF00">&nbsp; &lt;!-- rules go here --&gt;<br>
</font>&nbsp;&lt;/rules&gt;<br>
&lt;/collation&gt;</code></p>
<h3><a name="Collation_Version">Version</a></h3>
<p>All collations are specified by rules that are tailorings of the UCA, so the
specific version of the UCA is required.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><b>Note: </b>For version 3.1.1 of the UCA, the version of Unicode must
  also be specified with any versioning information. This has been changed as of
  the last UTC meeting, so that it will no longer be necessary as of UCA 4.0. So
  it is omitted here.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Setting_Options">Setting Options</a></h3>
<p>In XML, these are attributes of &lt;settings&gt;. For example, &lt;setting
strength=&quot;secondary&quot;&gt; will only compare strings based on their
primary and secondary weights.</p>
<p>If the attribute is not present, the default (or for the base url's
attribute, if there is one) is used. The default is listed in italics. The
effect of these are defined by reference to the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Collate_Customization.html">ICU
rule syntax</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="Rules">Collation Rule Syntax</a></h2>
<p>The goal for the collation rule syntax is to have clearly expressed rules
with a concise format, that parallels the Basic syntax as much as
possible.&nbsp; The rule syntax uses abbreviated element names for primary
(level 1), secondary (level 2), tertiary (level 3), and identical, to be as
short as possible. The reason for this is because the tailorings for CJK
characters are quite large (tens of thousands of elements), and the extra
overhead would have been considerable. Other elements and attributes do not
occur as frequently, and have longer names.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><i>Note: </i></b>The rules are stated in terms of actions that cause
  characters to change their ordering relative to other characters. This is for
  stability; assigning characters specific weights would not work, since the
  exact weight assignment in UCA (or ISO 14651) is not required for conformance
  -- only the relative ordering of the weights. In addition, stating rules in
  terms of relative order is less sensitive to changes over time in the UCA
  itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Orderings">Orderings</a></h3>
<p>The following are the normal ordering actions used for the bulk of
characters.</p>

<p>Resets only need to be at the start of a sequence, to position the characters
relative a character that is in the UCA (or has already occurred in the
tailoring). For example:
&lt;reset&gt;z&lt;/reset&gt;&lt;p&gt;a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d&lt;/p&gt;.</p>
<p>Some additional elements are provided to save space with large tailorings.
The addition of a 'c' to the element name indicates that each of the characters
in the contents of that element are to be handled as if they were separate
elements with the corresponding strength:</p>

<h3><a name="Escaping_Characters">Escaping Characters</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, XML does not have the capability to contain all Unicode code
points. Due to this, extra syntax is required to represent those code points
that cannot be otherwise represented. This corresponds to the quoting mechanism
used in the basic syntax. This also must be used where spaces are significant
(otherwise they are stripped).</p>

<h3><a name="Contractions">Contractions</a></h3>
<p>To sort a sequence as a single item (contraction), just use the sequence,

<h3><a name="Expansions">Expansions</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to handle expansions (where a character sorts as a
sequence) with both the basic syntax and the XML syntax. The first method is to
reset to the sequence of characters. The second is to use the extension
sequence. Both are equivalent in practice (unless the reset sequence happens to
be a contraction).</p>

<h3><a name="Context_Before">Context Before</a></h3>
<p>The context before a character can affect how it is ordered, such as in
Japanese. This could be expressed with a combination of contractions and
expansions, but is faster using a context. (The actual weights produced are
different, but the resulting string comparisons are the same.)</p>

<h3><a name="Placing_Characters_Before_Others">Placing Characters Before Others</a></h3>
<p>There are certain circumstances where characters need to be placed before a

where certain accented letters are positioned before the base letter. That is
accomplished with the following syntax.</p>

<p>Each of the above Names (except <i>implicits</i>) can be used with a reset to
position characters relative to that logical position. That allows characters to
be ordered before or after a <i>logical</i> position rather than a specific
character.</p>
<p class="note"><b><i>Note: </i></b>The reason for this is so that tailorings
can be more stable. A future version of the UCA might add characters at any
point in the above list. Suppose that you set character X to be after Y. It
could be that you want X to come after Y, no matter what future characters are
added; or it could be that you just want Y to come after a given logical
position, e.g. after the last primary ignorable.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the syntax:</p>
<table>
  <caption>Sample Logical Position</caption>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Basic</th>
      <th>XML</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>&amp; [first tertiary ignorable]<br>
        &lt;&lt; à&nbsp;</code></td>

        &lt;s&gt;à&lt;/s&gt;</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, to make a character be a secondary ignorable, one can make it be
immediately after (at a secondary level) a specific character (like a combining
dieresis), or one can make it be immediately after the last secondary ignorable.</p>
<p>The <i>last-variable</i> element indicates the &quot;highest&quot; character
that is treated as punctuation with alternate handling. Unlike the other logical
positions, it can be reset as well as referenced. For example, it can be reset
to be just above spaces if all visible punctuation are to be treated as having
distinct primary values.</p>

<p>The <i>suppress contractions</i> tailoring command turns off any existing
contractions that begin with those characters. It is typically used to turn off
the Cyrillic contractions in the UCA, since they are not used in many languages
and have a considerable performance penalty. The argument is a <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/unicodeSet.html">UnicodeSet</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>optimize</i> tailoring command is purely for performance. It indicates
that those characters are sufficiently common in the target language for the
tailoring that their performance should be enhanced.</p>

<h2>Appendix A: <a name="Sample_Special_Elements">Sample Special Elements</a></h2>
<p>The following are nonstandard elements provided as examples.</p>
<h3><a name="ICU">ICU</a></h3>
<p>There are three main areas where ICU has capabilies that go beyond what is
shown above.</p>
<p class="element2"><a name="&lt;ruleBasedNumberFormat&gt;">&lt;ruleBasedNumberFormat&gt;</a></p>
<p>The rule-based number format (RBNF) encapsulates a set of rules for mapping
binary numbers to and from a readable representation. They are typically used
for spelling out numbers, but can also be used for other number systems like
roman numerals, or for ordinal numbers (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>,...).
The rules are fairly sophisticated; for details see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/apiref/classRuleBasedNumberFormat.html#_details">Rule-Based
Number Format</a>.</p>
<p class="example">Example:</p>
<pre>&lt;special owner=&quot;http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ruleBasedNumberFormats&gt;
    &lt;ruleBasedNumberFormat type=&quot;spellout&quot;&gt;
                %%and:
                    and =%default=;
                    100: =%default=;
                %%commas:
                    ' and =%default=;
                    100: , =%default=;
                    1000: , 
    &lt;/ruleBasedNumberFormat&gt;
    &lt;ruleBasedNumberFormat type=&quot;ordinal&quot;&gt;
                %main:
                    =#,##0==%%abbrev=;
                %%abbrev:
                    th; st; nd; rd; th;
                    20: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
                    100: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;;
    &lt;/ruleBasedNumberFormat&gt;
    &lt;ruleBasedNumberFormat type=&quot;duration&quot;&gt;
            %with-words:
                0 seconds; 1 second; =0= seconds;
                60/60: 
    &lt;/ruleBasedNumberFormat&gt;
  &lt;/special&gt;
</pre>
<h3><a name="&lt;boundaries&gt;">&lt;boundaries&gt;</a></h3>
<p>Boundaries provide rules for grapheme-cluster (&quot;user-character&quot;),
word, line, and sentence breaks. This format is the Java/ICU syntax, at the top
level. For a description of that, see <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/docs/papers/RBBI-rule-syntax.html">RBBI
Rule Syntax</a>. (The format will be moved into the ICU User Guide soon.) The
enclosing special element is a sub-element of &lt;localeData&gt;.</p>
<pre>&lt;localeData&gt;
...
  &lt;special owner=&quot;http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu&quot;&gt;
    &lt;boundaries&gt;
      &lt;grapheme class=&quot;RuleBased&quot; append=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
        <span class="comment">&lt;!-- in addition to the normal rules, treat CH and RR as graphemes. --&gt;</span>
        [cC][hH];[rR][rR];
      &lt;/grapheme&gt;
      &lt;word class=&quot;Dictionary&quot; import=&quot;thaiDict.dat&quot; append=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
<span class="comment">        &lt;!-- When doing Thai word break, check the normal word break rules first. --&gt;
</span>        digit=[[:Nd:][:No:]];
        $digit [[:Pd:]­&#8231;&amp;apos;.]
      &lt;/word&gt;
    &lt;/boundaries&gt;
  &lt;/special&gt;
&lt;/localeData&gt;</pre>
<h3><a name="&lt;transforms&gt;">&lt;transforms&gt;</a></h3>
<p>There may be language-specific transformations, typically used in locale data
for transliterations. Such transformations require far more than a simple list
of matching characters, since the matches are highly context-sensitive. Each
such transform is supplied in a &lt;transform&gt; element. The contents of the
transform element is a list of rules, as described in the ICU documentation for <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Transliteration.html">Transforms</a>.
The enclosing special element is a sub-element of &lt;localeData&gt;. The target
value is either a script (long or short name) or a locale id.</p>
<p class="note">Note: there is an on-line demonstration of transforms at <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/icu/tr">Transforms
Demo.</a></p>
<p class="example">Example: The following is an abbreviated example for Greek to
Latin, in a Greek locale. The target value can be a script ID or a locale ID.</p>
<pre>&lt;localeData&gt;
...
  &lt;special  owner=&quot;http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu&quot;&gt;

<h3><a name="ISO_TR_14652">ISO TR 14652</a></h3>
<p>The following is <a href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg20/docs/n897-14652w25.pdf">ISO
TR 14652</a> compatibility data. This section is here because portions of TR
14652 data may used in LINUX distributions and other systems.</p>
<p class="note">Note: 14652 is a Type 1 TR: &quot;when the required support
cannot be obtained for the publication of an International Standard, despite
repeated effort&quot;. See the ballot comments on <a href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg20/docs/n948-J1N6769-14652.pdf">14652
Comments</a> for details on the 14652 defects. For example, most of these
patterns make little provision for substantial changes in format when elements
are empty, so are not particularly useful in practice. Compare, for example, the
mail-merge capabilities of production software such as Microsoft Word or
OpenOffice.</p>
