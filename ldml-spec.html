<h1>Locale Data Interchange Format</h1>
<p><i>2002-10-15, MED</i></p>
<h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
<p>This document describes the format for locale data interchange using XML. The
goal is to provide a mechanism for applications and systems to interchange
locale data, to access a common set of locale data, and to also enable access to
specific vendor versions of locale data. Versioning is provided for stability.</p>
<h2>What is a locale?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the XML structure, it is helpful to describe the model
behind the structure. People do not have to subscribe to this model to use the
data, but they do need to understand it so that the data can be correctly
translated into whatever model their implementation uses.</p>
<p>The first issue is basic: what is a locale? In this document, a locale is an
id that refers to a set of user preferences that tend to be shared across
significant swathes of the world. Traditionally, the data associated with this
id provides support for formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, and
currencies; for the default units of currency; for measurement units, for
sort-order (collation), plus translated names for timezones, languages,
countries, and scripts. They can also include text boundaries (character, word,
line, and sentence), transliterations, and support for other services.</p>
<p>Locale data is not cast in stone: the data used on someone's machine
generally may reflect the US format, but preferences can typically set to
override particular items, such as setting the data format for 2002.03.15, or
using metric instead of English measurement units. In the abstract, locales are
simply one of many sets of preferences that, say, a website may want to remember
for a particular user. Depending on the application, it may want to also
remember the user's timezone, preferred character set, smoker/non-smoker
preference, meal preference (vegetarian, kosher, etc.), music preference,
religion, party affiliation, favorite charity, etc. Users also customize their
preferences.</p>
<p>Locale data in a system may also change over time: country boundaries change;
governments (and currencies) come and go: committees impose new standards; bugs
are found and fixed in the source data; and so on. Thus the data needs to be
versioned for stability over time.</p>
<p>In general terms, the locale id is a parameter that is supplied to a
particular service (date formatting, sorting, spell-checking, etc.). The format
in this document does not attempt to collect together all the data that could
conceivably be used by all possible services. Instead, it collects together data
that is in common use in systems and internationalization libraries for basic
services.</p>
<p>We will speak of data as being &quot;in locale X&quot;. That does not imply
that a locale <i>is</i> a collection of data; it is simply shorthand for
&quot;the set of data associated with the locale id X&quot;. Each individual
piece of data is called a <i>resource</i>, and a tag indicating the type of
resource is called a <i>resource tag.</i></p>
<h2>Locale IDs</h2>
<p>A locale id consists of the following format:</p>
<pre>&lt;locale_id&gt; := &lt;base_locale_id&gt;&lt;options&gt;?</pre>
<pre>&lt;base_locale_id&gt; := &lt;language_code&gt;(&quot;_&quot;&lt;territory_code(&quot;_&quot;&lt;variant_code&gt;)?)?</pre>
<pre>&lt;options&gt; := &quot;@&quot;&lt;keyword&gt;&quot;=&quot;&lt;option_value&gt;(&quot;,&quot;&lt;keyword&gt;&quot;=&quot;&lt;option_value&gt;)*</pre>
<p>The &lt;language_code&gt;, &lt;territory_code&gt;, and &lt;variant_code&gt;
can only have ASCII letters. The &lt;language_code&gt; uses lowercase <a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_639.html">ISO-639</a>
values, using the 2-letter codes where they exist, and otherwise the 3-letter
codes. The &lt;territory_code&gt; (also called &lt;country_code&gt;) uses
uppercase <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO-3166</a>
2-letter values. The &lt;variant_code&gt; values are described below; they can
have lowercase ASCII letters.</p>
<p>The &lt;keyword&gt; can have lowercase ASCII letter andASCII digits, and the
&lt;option_value&gt; can have lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and
&quot;-&quot;. The allowable values are also described below in the XML format
section.</p>
<p><i>Example:</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>en<br>
  fr_be<br>
  de_de@collation=phonebook,currency=pre-euro</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The locale id format generally follows the description in the <a href="http://www.li18nux.org/docs/text/LocNameGuide-V10.txt">LI18NUX
Locale Name Guideline</a>. The differences from the those guidelines are that
(a) the locale id does not include a charset since the data in the locale is
always in Unicode, and (b) the locale id adds the ability to have a variant, as
in Java.</p>
<h2>Locale Inheritance</h2>
<p>The XML format relies on an inheritance model, whereby the resources are
collected into <i>bundles</i>, and the bundles organized into a tree. Data for
the many Spanish locales does not need to be duplicated across all of the
countries having Spanish as a national language. Instead, common data is
collected in the Spanish language locale, and country locales only need to
supply differences. The parent all of the language locales is a generic locale
known as <i>root</i>. For example, the collation order in the root is the UCA
(see UAX #10). Since English language collation is the same as that, the 'en'
locale data does not need to supply any collation data, nor does either the 'en_US'
or the 'en_IE' locale data.</p>
<p><b><i>[add diagram here]</i></b></p>
<p>Given a particular locale id &quot;en_US_someVariant&quot;, the search chain
for a particular resource is the following.</p>
<p>en_US_someVariant<br>
en_US<br>
en<br>
root</p>
<p>If a keyword is supplied in the locale id, then the chain is searched for a
resource tag with a given keyword, all the way up to root. If no resource is
found with that tag and keyword, then the chain is searched again without the
keyword. (There are currently no instances where there are multiple relevant
keywords.)</p>
<p>Thus the data for any given locale will only contain resources that are
different from the parent locale. For example, most country locales will inherit
the bulk of their data from the language locale: &quot;en&quot; will contain the
bulk of the data: &quot;en_US&quot; will only contain a few items like currency.
All data that is inherited from a parent is presumed to be valid, just as valid
as if it were physically present in the file.</p>
<p>Where this inheritance relationship does not match a target system, such as
POSIX, the data should be fully resolved in converting to a format for use by
that system, by adding <i>all</i> inherited data to each locale data set.</p>
<p>The locale data does not contain general character properties that are
derived from the Unicode Character Database data [<a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html">UCD</a>].
That data being common across locales, it is not duplicated in the bundles.
Constructing a POSIX locale from the following data requires use of that data.
In addition, POSIX locales may also specify the character encoding, which
requires the data to be transformed into that target encoding.</p>
<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>Data can be accessed by means of a URL. A locale URL has the following
structure:</p>
<pre>&lt;base&gt; &quot;/&quot; &lt;platform&gt; &quot;/&quot; &lt;base_locale_id&gt; &quot;.xml&quot; (&quot;/?&quot; (&quot;version=&quot; &lt;version&gt; | &lt;transformed_options&gt;)</pre>
<p>where version has the structure given below, and the transformed options are
&lt;options&gt; with the &quot;@&quot; removed, and &quot;,&quot; converted to
&quot;&amp;&quot;.</p>
<p><i>Example:</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locales/solaris/de_de@collation=phonebook,currency=pre-euro">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locales/solaris/de_de.xml/?version=2.1&amp;collation=phonebook&amp;currency=pre-euro</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>[above format is tentative]</b></i></p>
<h2>XML Format</h2>
<p>The high-level of the Locale Data element are:</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;identity&gt;<br>
&lt;layout&gt;<br>
&lt;encodings&gt;<br>
&lt;displayNames&gt;<br>
&lt;dates&gt;<br>
&lt;delimiters&gt;<br>
&lt;numbers&gt;<br>
&lt;collation&gt;<br>
&lt;boundaries&gt;<br>
&lt;countryInfo&gt;<br>
&lt;measurement&gt;</p>
<p>The structure of each of these elements and their contents will be described
below. Note that data below is <i>purely</i> illustrative, and doesn't match any
particular language.</p>
<h3>Common Elements</h3>
<p>At any level in any element, two special elements are allowed.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;special&gt;</p>
<p>This element is designed to allow for arbitrary additional annotation and
data that is product-specific. It has one required attribute, which specifies
the owner of the special data. For uniqueness, that owner is specified by means
of a URL. For example:</p>
<pre>    &lt;special owner=&quot;http://www.opengroup.org/regproducts/xu.htm&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- old abbreviations for pre-GUI days --&gt;
        &lt;messages&gt;
            &lt;no&gt;No&lt;/no&gt;
            &lt;yes&gt;Yes&lt;/yes&gt;
            &lt;shortYes&gt;Y&lt;/shortYes&gt;
            &lt;shortNo&gt;N&lt;/shortNo&gt;
        &lt;/messages&gt;
    &lt;/special&gt;</pre>
<p class="element2"><b>&lt;alias source=&quot;&lt;locale_URL&gt;&quot;&gt;</b></p>
<p>The contents of any element can be replaced by an alias, which points to
another locale. The resource is to be fetched from that location. Normal
resource searching is to be used, so with</p>
<p>&lt;localeData&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;collation&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;alias source=&quot;<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locales/solaris/de_de@collation=phonebook,currency=pre-euro">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locales/solaris/de_de.xml/?version=2.1&amp;collation=phonebook</a>&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;/collation&gt;<br>
&lt;/localeData&gt;</p>
<p>the resource bundle at &quot;de_de&quot; will be searched for a resource
element at the same position in the tree with keyword &quot;collation&quot;. If
not found there, then the resource bundle at &quot;de&quot; will be searched,
etc.</p>
<h3>Common Attributes</h3>
<p class="element2">&lt;...keyword=&quot;Stroke&quot;...&gt;</p>
<p>The attribute <i>keyword</i> is used to indicate an alternate resource that
should only be selected with a matching keyword=option in the locale id
modifiers. For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;localeData&gt;
  ...
  &lt;currencies&gt;
    &lt;currency&gt;...&lt;/currency&gt;
    &lt;currency keyword=&quot;preEuro&quot;&gt;...&lt;/currency&gt;
  &lt;/currencies&gt;
&lt;/localeData&gt;</pre>
<pre>The currently defined keywords include</pre>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

<p class="element2">&nbsp;&lt;... displayName=&quot;...&quot; ...&gt;</p>
<p>Almost all elements can have a display name, a translated name that can be
presented to users when discussing the particular service.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3>&lt;identity&gt;</h3>
<p>The identity element contains information identifying the target locale for
this data, and general information about the version of this data.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;generation date=&quot;2002-08-28&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The generation element contains the last modified date for the data. The data
is in XML Schema format (yyyy-mm-dd).</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;version number=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>The version element provides, in an attribute, the version of this file.
Versions are in the format &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;(.&lt;update&gt;)? The
contents of the element can contain textual notes about the changes between this
version and the last. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;version number=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;Various notes and changes in version 1.1&lt;/version&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><i><b>[Ed note: this element is changed, since the versioning is external!]</b></i></p>
<p class="element2">&lt;language id=&quot;en&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The language id is the main part of the specification of the locale id. The
value is any code from the <a href="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_639.html">ISO-639</a>
standard; a two-letter code if available, otherwise a 3-letter code. (The
mapping between 2-letter codes and 3-letter codes is not part of this format.)
All language IDs are case-insensitive.</p>
<p><i><b>[Ed note: remove &quot;name =&quot;]</b></i></p>
<p class="element2">&lt;country id=&quot;US&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The country id is the secondary part of the specification of the locale id.
The two letter country code uses the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO-3166</a>
standard. All country IDs are case-insensitive. Note that some entities given
country codes are better termed &quot;regions&quot;, since they may be
considered parts of other countries.</p>
<p><i><b>[Ed note: remove &quot;name =&quot;]</b></i></p>
<p class="element2">&lt;variant id=&quot;Sort&quot;
value=&quot;Traditional&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>There can be any number of variant IDs. These specify particular variants of
the locale, typically with special options. The currently defined variants
include: (for norwegian: bo = Bokmål, al = Åland, ny = Nynorsk</p>
<p><i><b>[Ed note: consider having the &lt;language_code&gt; be 1766]</b></i></p>
<p class="element2">&lt;correspondsTo type=&quot;lcid&quot;
value=&quot;0409&quot;/&gt;</p>
<pre><i><b>[Ed note: change this element -- doesn't really want to be special]</b></i></pre>
<p>There can be one or more elements indicate that the identity of this locale,
as specified by language + country + variants, corresponds to an alternative id
style. Currently the only type is lcid. Macintosh id's may be added in the
future.</p>
<h2>&lt;layout&gt;</h2>
<p>This top-level element specifies general layout features. It currently only
has one possible element (other than &lt;special&gt;, which is always
permitted).</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;orientation lines=&quot;top-to-bottom&quot;
characters=&quot;left-to-right&quot; /&gt;</p>
<pre>The lines and characters attributes specify the default general ordering of lines, and characters within a line. The values are:</pre>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" rowspan="2">Vertical</td>
    <td width="50%">top-to-bottom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">bottom-to-top</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" rowspan="2">Horizontal</td>
    <td width="50%">left-to-right</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">right-to-left</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If the lines value is vertical then the characters value must be horizontal,
and vice versa. This does not override the ordering behavior of bidirectional
text; it does, however, supply the paragraph direction for that text (for more
information, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>).</p>
<h2>&lt;encodings&gt;</h2>
<p>The encodings element does not, unlike POSIX, specify the encoding of the
data itself. Instead, it provide optional information that can be helpful in
picking among character encodings that are typically used to transmit data in
the language of this locale. It typically only occurs in a language locale, not
in a language/country locale.</p>
<p>There is one optional attribute on the encodings element itself:
requiredLetters=&quot;a-zåæø&quot; indicates that normal usage of the
language of this locale requires these letters. The list of characters is in
UnicodeSet format. An encoding that cannot encompass at least these letters is
inappropriate for encoding data in the language of this locale.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;mapping&gt;</p>
<p>There can be multiple mapping elements. Each indicates the character
conversion mapping table name (in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/">UTR
#22</a> format) for a character encoding that is commonly used to encode data in
the language of this locale. The version field of the mapping table is omitted.
The ordering among the mapping elements is not significant. The mapping elements
themselves are not inherited from parents.</p>
<h2>&lt;displayNames&gt;</h2>
<p>Display names for scripts, languages, countries, and variants in this locale
are supplied by this element. These supply localized names for these items for
use in user-interfaces. Examples are given below.</p>
<p class="element2">&lt;scripts&gt;</p>
<p>This element can contain an number of script elements. Each script element
provides the localized name for a script, given by ID. The script IDs can be
either the long or short forms from Scripts.txt in the UCD. (See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr24/">UTR
#24: Script Names</a> for more information.) For example, in the language of
this locale, the name for the Latin script might be &quot;Romana&quot;, and for
the Cyrillic script is &quot;Kyrillica&quot;. That would be expressed with the
following.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;script id=&quot;Latin&quot;&gt;Romana&lt;/script&gt;<br>
  &lt;script id=&quot;Cyrillic&quot;&gt;Kyrillica&lt;/script&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;languages&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;language id=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;Abkhazian&lt;/language&gt;<br>
  &lt;language id=&quot;aa&quot;&gt;Afar&lt;/language&gt;<br>
  &lt;language id=&quot;af&quot;&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/language&gt;<br>
  &lt;language id=&quot;sq&quot;&gt;Albanian&lt;/language&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;countries&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;country id=&quot;AF&quot;&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/country&gt;<br>
  &lt;country id=&quot;AL&quot;&gt;Albania&lt;/country&gt;<br>
  &lt;country id=&quot;DZ&quot;&gt;Algeria&lt;/country&gt;<br>
  &lt;country id=&quot;AD&quot;&gt;Andorra&lt;/country&gt;<br>
  &lt;country id=&quot;AO&quot;&gt;Angola&lt;/country&gt;<br>
  &lt;country id=&quot;US&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/country&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;variants&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;variant id=&quot;NY&quot;&gt;Nynorsk&lt;/country&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;keywords&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;keyword id=&quot;collation&quot;&gt;Sortierung&lt;/keyword &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;options&gt;</p>
<p>Since the translation of an option name may depend on the keyword it is used
with, the latter is optionally supplied.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;option keyword=&quot;collation id=&quot;phonebook&quot;&gt;Telefonbuch&lt;/option
  &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="element2">&lt;localePatterns&gt;</p>
<p>This consists of a Java/ICU choice format syntax for producing the name of a
locale in a particular language.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;locale&gt;{0,choice,0#|1#{1}|2#{1} ({2})}&lt;/locale&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;list&gt;{0,choice,0#|1#{1}|2#{1},{2}|3#{1},{2},{3}}&lt;/list&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;composition&gt;{0},{1}&lt;/composition&gt;</p>
<p><i><b>[Ed. Note: explain this]</b></i></p>
<h2>&lt;dates&gt;</h2>
<p>This top-level element contains information regarding the format/parsing of
dates and times. It contains multiple calendar elements, each of which specifies
the fields used for formatting and parsing dates and times according to the
given calendar. Most of these are self-explanatory, except the following. For
more information, see the Java API [add link].</p>
