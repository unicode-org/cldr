    <p><strong>Important notes for CLDR 36 and later:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The CLDR repository has switched from subversion to git.</li>
      <li>Data in the main CLDR repository now includes some elements with the value “↑↑↑” indicating
    	that translators have explicitly determined that the inherited value should always be used.</li>
      <li>To generate data in the form that was used for CLDR 35.1 and earlier, in which “↑↑↑” is
    	resolved appropriately (either removed or replaced with an apropriate value) and other minimization
    	is performed, a new tool GenerateProductionData is provided (command-line options provide the
    	ability to specify source and destination directory, among other things).</li>
      <li>CLDR data that has been processed by GenerateProductionData is available in the parallel
    	“cldr-staging” repository.</li>
    </ul>
