This is the XML DTD for the Servlet 2.3 deployment descriptor.
All Servlet 2.3 deployment descriptors must include a DOCTYPE
of the following form:

  <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
	"-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
	"http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">

-->
<!--
The following conventions apply to all J2EE deployment descriptor
elements unless indicated otherwise.

- In elements that contain PCDATA, leading and trailing whitespace
  in the data may be ignored.

- In elements whose value is an "enumerated type", the value is
  case sensitive.

- In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the same
  JAR file, relative filenames (i.e., those not starting with "/")
  are considered relative to the root of the JAR file's namespace.
  Absolute filenames (i.e., those starting with "/") also specify
  names in the root of the JAR file's namespace.  In general, relative
  names are preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
  names are preferred for consistency with the servlet API.
-->
<!--
The web-app element is the root of the deployment descriptor for
a web application.

<!--
The auth-constraint element indicates the user roles that should
be permitted access to this resource collection. The role-name
used here must either correspond to the role-name of one of the
security-role elements defined for this web application, or be
the specially reserved role-name "*" that is a compact syntax for
indicating all roles in the web application. If both "*" and
rolenames appear, the container interprets this as all roles.
If no roles are defined, no user is allowed access to the portion of
the web application described by the containing security-constraint.
The container matches role names case sensitively when determining
access.

<!--
The auth-method element is used to configure the authentication
mechanism for the web application. As a prerequisite to gaining access to any web resources which are protected by an authorization
