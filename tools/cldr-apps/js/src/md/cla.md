# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If you would like to sign Unicode’s standard CLA so that you may contribute to other Unicode projects as well as Survey Tool, please refer to our [IP Policies](https://www.unicode.org/policies/licensing_policy.html) to find out how to get a standard CLA in place.

*Alternatively*, if you do not wish to sign Unicode’s standard CLA and you wish to contribute only to the CLDR Survey Tool, you may agree to the following terms for your Survey Tool contributions:

1. You represent and agree that the contributed matter is not proprietary or confidential to you or your employer or any third party; and/or
2. You grant to Unicode and to recipients of products distributed by Unicode a perpetual, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide, nonexclusive, no-charge, royalty-free license, without obligation for accounting, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, make, use, sell, offer to sell, or import that matter for any purpose, with the unrestricted right to sublicense those rights.
