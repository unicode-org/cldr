# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Hello. We need your permission to use the data and information that you submit to the Unicode CLDR Survey Tool. To do this, we need a contributor license agreement (CLA) on file for you or your employer so that Unicode has the required permissions to use your contributions in our products and services. If you are seeing this message, it means we do not have such a CLA on file. If you believe you are already under a Unicode CLA (either your own or your employer’s) and are seeing this message in error, or if you have further questions, please contact [`cldr-cla@unicode.org`](mailto:cldr-cla@unicode.org).

If you would like to sign Unicode’s standard CLA so that you may contribute to other Unicode projects as well as Survey Tool, please refer to our [IP Policies](https://www.unicode.org/policies/licensing_policy.html) to find out how to get a standard CLA in place.

*Alternatively*, if you do not wish to sign Unicode’s standard CLA and you wish to contribute only to the CLDR Survey Tool, you may agree to the following terms for your Survey Tool contributions:

1. You represent and agree that the contributed matter is not proprietary or confidential to you or your employer or any third party; and/or
2. You grant to Unicode and to recipients of products distributed by Unicode a perpetual, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide, nonexclusive, no-charge, royalty-free license, without obligation for accounting, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, make, use, sell, offer to sell, or import that matter for any purpose, with the unrestricted right to sublicense those rights.
