/**
 * Uniquely identify members that participate in queues to receive data; associate an arbitrary
 * object with each member
 *
 * <p>A member may be (1) a user (maybe logged in), identified by their CookieSession, or (2) an
 * automatically scheduled background operation not initiated by a particular user
 *
 * <p>Multiple HTTP requests and responses may be required for the same user to fetch the same data
 * set -- gathering the data is assumed to be a potentially long-running task
 *
 * <p>When there are concurrent requests by multiple users, the CookieSession is used for
 * determining which requests are from the same user
 *
 * <p>The associated object could be anything, depending on the caller; for VettingViewerQueue, the
 * object might belong to the class org.unicode.cldr.web.VettingViewerQueue.QueueEntry
 *
 * <p>The "key" parameter for the put/set methods enables reusing this class for different kinds of
 * queue
 *
 * <p>For VettingViewerQueue, the key might be VettingViewerQueue.class.getName(); other kinds of
 * queues should have distinct keys
 *
 * <p>For a given key, there is assumed to be no more than one "automatic" queue member at a time
 *
 * <p>This class is meant to be re-usable and not to depend on VettingViewerQueue
