/**
 * Cache example html strings for ExampleGenerator.
 *
 * <p>Essentially, the cache simply maps from xpath+value to html.
 *
 * <p>The complexity of this class is mostly for the sake of handling dependencies where the example
 * for pathB+valueB depends not only on pathB and valueB, but also on the current <em>winning</em>
 * values of pathA1, pathA2, ...
 *
 * <p>Some examples in the cache must get cleared when a changed winning value for a path makes the
 * cached examples for other paths possibly no longer correct.
 *
 * <p>For example, let pathA = "//ldml/localeDisplayNames/languages/language[@type=\"aa\"]" and
 * pathB = "//ldml/localeDisplayNames/territories/territory[@type=\"DJ\"]". The values, in locale
 * fr, might be "afar" for pathA and "Djibouti" for pathB. The example for pathB might include "afar
 * (Djibouti)", which depends on the values of both pathA and pathB.
 *
 * <p>Each ExampleGenerator object, which is for one locale, has its own ExampleCache object.
 *
 * <p>This cache is internal to each ExampleGenerator. Compare TestCache.exampleGeneratorCache,
 * which is at a higher level, caching entire ExampleGenerator objects, one for each locale.
 *
 * <p>Unlike TestCache.exampleGeneratorCache, this cache doesn't get cleared to conserve memory,
 * only to adapt to changed winning values.
