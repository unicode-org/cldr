# List of locales which are somehow special (such as Read-Only)
# Format of each line:
#
#    loc_id ; type ; comment
#
# loc_id is an explicit id, and does NOT include sublocales unless it is followed by *
#
# type is an enumerated value and has value(s):
#     readonly - locale must not be modified in the SurveyTool
#     scratch  - Locale is for testing purposes
#
#
# comment is freeform text and may be presented to end users.  Use the form  " @de_CH " to refer to the locale de_CH
#    and "@@" to refer to the actual locale (in the case of * wildcards)
#
# Note: Also, see CLDRFileTransformer.java which has the algorithmic locales defined
# such as sr_Latn, etc. Those are no longer listed here.
