				<td>The main goal for CLDR language data is to provide
					approximate figures for the literate, functional population for
					each language in each territory: that is, the population that is
					able to read and write each language, and is comfortable enough to
					use it with computers.
					<p>The GDP and Literacy figures are taken from the World Bank
						where available, otherwise supplemented by FactBook data and other
						sources. The GDP figures are "PPP (constant 2000 international
						$)". Much of the per-language data is taken from the Ethnologue,
						but is supplemented and processed using many other sources,
						including per-country census data. (The focus of the Ethnologue is
						native speakers, which includes people who are not literate, and
						excludes people who are functional second-langauge users.)</p>
					<p>
						The literacy rate may be discounted to reflect the actual usage of
						the written form in normal daily life. Thus languages that are
						typically not written, such as Swiss German, will be given a low
						literacy rate, even though the whole population <i>could</i> write
						in Swiss German.
					</p>
					<p>The percentages may add up to more than 100% due to
						multilingual populations, or may be less than 100% due to
						illiteracy or because the data has not yet been gathered or
						processed. Languages with a small population may be omitted.</p>
					<p>Official status is supplied where available, formatted as
						{O}. Hovering with the mouse shows a short description.</p>

					<p>
						Languages vary in how they handle plurals of nouns or unit
						expressions ("hours", "meters", and so on). Some languages have
						two forms, like English; some languages have only a single form;
						and some languages have multiple forms (see <a href="#sl">Slovenian</a>
						below). They also vary between cardinals (such as 1, 2, or 3) and
						ordinals (such as 1st, 2nd, or 3rd), and in ranges of cardinals
						(such as "1-2", used in expressions like "1-2 meters long"). CLDR
						uses short, mnemonic tags for these plural categories. For more
						information on these categories, see <a
							href="http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules" target='spec'>Plural
							Rules</a>.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Examples:</b> The symbol ~ (as in "1.7~2.1") has a
							special meaning: it is a range of numbers that includes the end
							points (1.7 and 2.1), and everything between that has exactly the
							same number of decimals as the end points (thus also 1.8, 1.9,
							and 2.0, but not 2 or 1.91 or 1.90). The samples are generated mechanically, and
							are not comprehensive: “0, 2~19, 101~119, …” could show up as the less-complete
							“0, 2~16, 101 …”.</li>
						<li><strong>Rules:</strong> The plural categories are computed based on machine-readable rules, 
						using the syntax described in <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Language_Plural_Rules" target='spec'>Language Plural Rules</a>. 
						In particular, they use special variables and relation defined in <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-numbers.html#Operands" target='spec'>Plural Rule Operands</a>
