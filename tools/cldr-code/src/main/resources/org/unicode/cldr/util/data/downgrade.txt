# Format is 
#    locale-regex ; path-regex ; value-regex
# Where a field is missing, it matches all values
# The match uses 'looking at', equivalent to starting with ^ â€” so don't start with that
# If you need to match to the end, follow with $
# For the path, [@ is automatically escaped

# For v46 and later, currently there are no paths to be downgraded
