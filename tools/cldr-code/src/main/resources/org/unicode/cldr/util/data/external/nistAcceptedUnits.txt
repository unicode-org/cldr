# The term "acceptable units," which is introduced in this Guide for convenience, is used to mean the SI units plus 
# (a) those non-SI units accepted for use with the SI (see Tables 6 - 9); and 
# (b) appropriate multiples and submultiples of such accepted non-SI units.

# Modifications

# minute—time, etc => minute
# degree—plane angle(a) => degree
# minute—plane angle(a) => arc-minute
# second—plane angle(a) => arc-second
# hectare(h) => hectare
# L(b),1 => L
# metric ton(c) => tonne
# rad(a) => rad
# ångström => angstrom
