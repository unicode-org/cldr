# Format is 
#    locale-regex ; path-regex ; value-regex
# Where a field is missing, it matches all values
# The match uses 'looking at', equivalent to starting with ^ â€” so don't start with that
# If you need to match to the end, follow with $
# For the path, [@ is automatically escaped

# The following will match anything starting with graphics-dot, thus include graphics-dot-per-centimeter, etc.
 ; //ldml/units/unitLength[@type="long"]/unit[@type="graphics-dot

# The rest of the paths from https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-16503 need to be included
