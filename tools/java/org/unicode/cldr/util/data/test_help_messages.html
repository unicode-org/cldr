to Insert</i> is what you want to show up as help text, or modify existing text. <b>The software that interprets this expects a particular format, so don't make 
arbitrary changes (see the end). </b></p>

      <h3>Display Names</h3>


		
      
      <p>Languages,
scripts (writing systems), territories (countries and regions),
currencies, and time zones are represented in computers by internal
codes, such as "<code>fr</code>" for the French language or "<code>CA</code>" for the country of Canada.</p>


		
      
      <p><i>The ISO names and the "official" names are often not the best ones for CLDR.</i>
The goal is the most customary name used in your language, even if it
is not the official name. For example, for the territory name in
English you would use "Switzerland" instead of "Swiss Confederation",
and use "United Kingdom" instead of "The United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland". The best source for customary usage is
to look at what common publications such as newspapers and magazines
do. For example, to see how Congo is used in French, one might search <a target="_blank" onClick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Congo+site%3Alemonde.fr">
		http://www.google.com/search?q<wbr>=Congo+site%3Alemonde.fr</a> and other publications.</p>


		
      
      <p>All names <b>must</b> be unique within a given category: thus one cannot use the same translated name for the following two codes; <i>only one can be called "Congo":</i></p>

      <h3>Territories</h3>


		
      
      <p>Territories
include both country names and regions: continents and subcontinents
(defined by a UN standard). All of these must be unique: for example,
you can't give the same name to the country <i>South Africa</i> (the country) and to <i>Southern Africa</i> (the southern region of the continent of Africa), 
		even though there may be no distinction in your language between the terms for "<i>South</i>" and "<i>Southern</i>". Similarly, <i>North America</i> is 
		the continent that extends down to Panama; <i>Northern America</i> is the region of the Americas north of Mexico.</p>


		
      
      <p>The
country name should be the most natural; you may have to adjust the
name of the region. So you might say the equivalent of "South Region of
Africa", or add clarifying language like "<span class="loser"><i>Amérique du Nord continentale</i>" vs "<i>Amérique du Nord</i>". If you have any question as to 
		the extent of any region, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/supplemental/territory_containment_un_m_49.html">Territory Containment</a>.

other items already translated.

      <p>There are a lot of languages here (around 500), and you <em>don't</em> need to look at them all! Many are relatively obscure, and not worth translating 
		in a first pass. Please also look at the following points.</p>


		
      
      <ul>


			<li>Please
use phrasing corresponding to the English "Baltic Language" for
language collections. That is, use terms that would be appropriate to
use for indicating that the target text is "a" Baltic Language, without
terms that imply exclusion or multiplicity such as "other" (autre),
etc. or "languages" (plural).</li>

      <h3>Compound Language Codes</h3>


		
      
      <p>Some language codes are more complex, of the form "en_AU" for <i>Australian English</i>.
If you don't add a translation, then those will be represented by a
format like "αγγλικά (Αυστραλία)". That is, the translation would be
the native name for "English", followed by the native word for
"Australia" in parentheses. If that format is ok, then you don't need
to translate the more complex language code. The codes zh_Hant and
zh_Hans (for Traditional and Simplified Chinese) on the other hand,
should always be translated. </p>


		
      
      <p>There are a few special cases: </p>


		
      
      <ul>


			<li>"Iberian Portuguese" is the style of Portuguese used in Portugal (as opposed to Brazil)</li>


			<li>Similarly "Iberian Spanish" is the style of Spanish used in Spain (as opposed to Latin America).</li>


			<li>"Swiss High German" (<i>Schweizer Hochdeutsch</i>), also called "Swiss Standard German", has the code <code>de_CH</code>.</li>


			<li>"Swiss German" (<i>Schwyzerdütsch</i>) has the code <code>gsw</code>.</li>


		
      
      </ul>

      
      <p>A
pattern is used to control how the translations for language and region
codes are composed into a name when the compound code doesn't have a
specific translation. See the section "localeDisplayPattern".</p>

      <h3>Currencies</h3>


		
      
      <p>This
is a long list that contains the currency names and currency symbols
for each country, plus historical codes. The coverage level option
tries to pick out the ones that are most important to translate. Each
currency code can be translated in two ways:</p>


		
      
      <ul>


			<li>As a symbol for use in formatting amounts (such as "12 345,68 <b>US$</b>"), and</li>


			<li>As a name, typically used to show a list of currencies (such as "<b>dollar des États-Unis</b>")</li>


			<li>With names, the common question of
whether to capitalize or not, arises. With the introduction of pluralized
units in CLDR 1.6, it is recognized that currency names may be used equally
in menus and flowing text.  Therefore, for a new locale, use whatever 
practice is best suited for use in either <b>menus</b> or <b>flowing text</b>
          <i>(we recognize that the capitalization rule you adopt may have limitations,
and we endeavour to add additional features to the Survey Tool, in the future
to alleviate some of these limitations )</i>.
For an existing locale,

other items already translated.

      <h3>Exemplar Character Set</h3>


		
      
      <p>The
exemplar character sets contain the commonly used letters for a given
modern form of a language. These are used for testing and for
determining the appropriate repertoire of letters for charset
conversion or text comparison. The term "letter" is interpreted
broadly, and includes characters used to form words, such as 是 or 가. If
a sequence of characters is considered a "letter", it will be listed
between { and }. For example, <em>{ch}</em>.</p>


		
      
      <p>There are three categories:</p>


		
      
      <ul>


			<li>The <i>standard</i> characters are those used in customary writing, such as [a-z] for English.</li>


			<li>The <i>auxiliary</i>
characters are additional characters used in foreign words found in
typical magazines, newspapers, &amp;c. For example, you could see the
name Schröder in English in a magazine, so <i>ö</i> is in the set. However, it is very uncommon to see <i>ł</i>, so that isn't in the auxiliary 
			set for English. Publication style guides, such as <i>The Economist Style Guide</i> for English, are useful for this.</li>


			<li>The <i>currency</i> characters are additional characters used in currency symbols, like 'US$ 1,234'.</li>
			<li>The <em>index</em> characters are used as an index for categories of items. Unlike the other characters, it should have either uppercase or lowercase, depending on what is typical for the language. Note that if the character set is large without fixed standard sorting (such as Chinese), the value [] should be used.<em class="draft"> A draft set of characters was mechanically generated, and will need adjustments: for example, characters or strings that never occur at the start of words are typically removed.</em></li>


		
      
      </ul>


The exemplar set is not a complete set of letters used for a language:
punctuation and other symbols are not included, nor uppercase letters
(except for Turkish İ). The Survey Tool will flag certain fields with <img alt="The image “http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/warn.png” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/warn.png">
if they use characters that are not in exemplar sets. In some cases,
this is not truly an error, such as where "NaN" is used in numbers. In
other cases, the possible actions for you are are: 
      
    <ul>


			<li>Fix the field value to not use the character.</li>


			<li>Fix the exemplar sets, because the character actually is acceptable in your language in one of the above categories.</li>


		
      
      </ul>


		
      
      <p align="left">Any range of characters, such as "a b c d e" can be represented compactly as "a-e". For more information, please see <i>

grouping separator for your language is an apostrophe, and the decimal
separator is a comma. Translators should not change the pattern of
zeros (0) or hash marks (#); those will be reset by software. This is
true also for currency formats. Even if your currency doesn't use any
decimal points, the currency format will have them in the pattern. You
need to modify the patterns when:</p>


		
      
      <ul>


			<li>The grouping separator is not by thousands (eg Hindi). </li>


			<li>The
negative pattern doesn't simply add a minus sign. For example, if a
negative number is formed by adding parentheses, then this would look
like: #,##0.###;(#,##0.###). That is, the negative form gets added
after a semicolon.</li>

start and end, such as "Sept 10-12" (meaning the 10th of September
through the 12th of September). The
pattern will be something like "MMM d–d", where some of the fields are
repeated -- typically with some kind of punctuation mark separating the
two fields, but some fields in the second part are omitted. The way
this pattern is used is that the part up to the first
repeated field is formatted with the first date, and the remainder is
formatted with the second date. For example:</p>

      <p align="left">Make
sure that the correct forms are provided, especially for the months, and used in the patterns. That
is, suppose that the language uses "Dezembro" for December when
standing alone, but "Dezembru" when with a date (meaning the nth day <em>of</em> that month). Then the formats for months could be something like:</p>

      <h3>Metazones</h3>


		
      
      <p>For some time zones, the survey tool will state that a particular <i>metazone</i> is in effect. A metazone is simply a grouping of time zones that share 
		a common display name in customary usage. For example, <code>Europe/Paris</code>, <code>Europe/Berlin</code>, and many other time zones share a common display 
		name "Central European Time", and have a common metazone <code>Europe_Central</code>.
Use of a metazone allows us to translate this text only once while it
can be use in many different time zones. The survey tool will show the
default mappings for when a particular metazone was in use for a
particular time zone. If you believe the mappings to be incorrect for
your locality, please use the link to record any desired changes to the
metazone mappings. Metazones have the same display fields as regular
time zones, except that they have no exemplar city associated with
them. </p>


		
      
      <p>Often
there are situations where a particular time zone has an abbreviation,
but the abbreviation is so seldom used that most people would not
recognize it. The "commonlyUsed" field for a metazone is used to
indicate that abbreviations for a particular time zone or metazone are
in common use in the locale. You have two choices:</p>


		
      
      <ul>


			<li>If the GMT format would be understood better, set commonlyUsed to "false"</li>


			<li>Otherwise, if the abbriviation is commonly understood, set commonlyUsed&nbsp; to "true".</li>


		
      
      </ul>


		
      
      <p>For example: In English, PST is a commonly used abbreviation for "Pacific Standard Time", for the metazone<code> </code><code>America_Pacific</code>.
While NPT is an abbreviation for "Nepal Time", most English speakers
would not recognize the meaning of "2:00 PM NPT". Thus, commonlyUsed
should be <i>true</i> 
		for <code>America_Pacific</code> (displaying, for example, 2:00 PM PST) and <i>false</i> for <code>Asia/Katmandu</code> (displaying, for example, "4:00 
		GMT+05:45").</p>

      <h3>Locale Fallbacks</h3>


		
      
      <p>You should add here a list of locales that would be most natural to use when no translation is available (this is called a <i>fallback)</i>.
This is especially useful for minority languages. For example, for Breton [br]
the most natural language to fall back to might be French [fr], that is, to
use French names for countries that aren't translated. Similarly, the
fallback for Moldavian [mo] might be Romanian [ro].</p>

      
      <p style="font-style: italic;">Fallbacks should <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span>
be included if a substantial majority of people speaking the language in
question would be likely to understand the fallback language. If there
are no such languages, the fallback field should be left blank.</p>

      
      <p>Fallbacks can
take the script or region into account; the fallback for Northern Sámi (Finland)
[se-FI] might be Finnish (Finland) [fi-FI], while the fallback for Northern Sámi
[se] generally might be Norwegian [nb].<br>

      </p>

      
      <p>The values you
need to use are locale codes, <span style="font-style: italic;">not the 
		names or translations;</span> thus you would put in&nbsp;<code>fr</code> or&nbsp;<code>fr_BE</code>,<i> not</i> "French" or "<span class="loser">français</span>". If you don't know the codes for the languages in question, you can consult the survey tool <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/apps/survey?p_codes=t" target="_blank">Locales</a>, or the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry" target="_blank">BCP 47 registry</a>.</p>

      
      <p>Multiple fallback languages can be entered in order of priority, separated by spaces, for example: nl en.</p>

      <h3>Localized Units</h3>

      
      <p>Localized units provide more natural ways of expressing unit phrases
that vary in plural form, such as "1 hour" vs "2 hours". While they
cannot express all the intricacies of natural languages, they allow for
more natural phrasing than constructions like "1 hour(s)".<span style="font-style: italic; color: black;"></span><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p>

      
      <p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Please&nbsp;</span>review the draft rules that CLDR is using for plurals for your language, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html">Language Plural Rules</a>, and the description there about&nbsp;the plural categories.</p>

      
      <p>Each unit may have multiple plural forms, one for each category. These are composed with numbers using a <span style="font-style: italic;">unitPattern</span>
of the form "{0} {1}". A formatted number will be substituted in place
of the "{0}", while the unit value will be subsituted in place of the
"{1}".</p>

      
      <p>For example, for English if the unit is an <span style="font-family: monospace;">hour</span> and the number is <span style="font-family: monospace;">1234</span>, then the number is looked up to get the rule category <span style="font-family: monospace;">other</span>. The number is then formatted into "1,234" and composed with the unitName for <span style="font-family: monospace;">other</span> and the unitPattern for <span style="font-family: monospace;">other</span> to get the final result. Examples are in the table below.

      <h3>Locale Display Patterns</h3>

      <br>

Locale
display patterns are used to format a compound language (locale) name
such as 'en_AU' or 'uz_Arab'. The pattern is something like "{0}
({1})". When the locale is formatted,
the language is substituted for {0}, and the region or script for {1}.
      <br>

      
      <p>For example, take "en_AU". First the language code 'en' is
translated, such as to "anglais", then the country is translated, such
as "Australie". The patterns is used to put those together, into
something like "anglais (Australie)". &nbsp;This works the same way if
there is a script; for example, &nbsp;"uz-Arab" =&gt; "ouzbek (arabe)".</p>

If there is both a script and a region, then a list is formed using the <span style="font-style: italic;">separator</span>, then {1} is replaced by that list, such as "uz-Arab-AF" =&gt; "ouzbek (arabe, Afghanistan)"<br>

      
      <p>For
certain compound language (locale) names, you can also supply specific
translations. Thus for the whole locale 'en_GB', you can provide a
translation like "Australian English".</p>

      <td>
      
      <h3>Code Patterns</h3>

Code
patterns are used in lists where the name of the language, script, or
region is not available -- the code (like "de" for German) will be
substituted for the {0} placeholder. &nbsp;Thus you if the language
code 'zaz' is not translated in your language, you might see in a list
something like:<br>

      
      <ul>

        <li>English</li>

        <li>French</li>

        <li>Language: zaz</li>

        <li>Spanish</li>

      
      </ul>

The
last line is the result of substituting the code 'zaz' into the code
pattern. You can choose the pattern that makes sense for your language;
if the best choice is to just use the code alone, then use {0}.</td>
