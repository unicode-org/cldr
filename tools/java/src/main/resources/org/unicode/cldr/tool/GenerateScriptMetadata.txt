# CLDR data files are interpreted according to the LDML specification (http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/)

# This file provides general information about scripts that may be useful to implementations processing text.
# The information is the best currently available, and may change between versions of CLDR.
# 
# Format:
#	The data is not in XML; instead it uses the semicolon-delimited format from the Unicode Character Database (UCD).
#	This is so that parsers of the UCD can more easily be adapted to read the data. 
#	Additional fields may be added in future versions; parsers may be designed to ignore those fields until they are revised.
#
# Field - Description
#
# 0 - Script Identifier
# 1 - Web Rank:
#		The approximate rank of this script from a large sample of the web, 
#		in terms of the number of characters found in that script.
#		Below 32 the ranking is not statistically significant.
# 2 - Sample Character:
#		A sample character for use in "Last Resort" style fonts.
#               For printing the combining mark for Zinh in a chart, U+25CC can be prepended.
#		See http://unicode.org/policies/lastresortfont_eula.html
# 3 - Origin country:
#		The approximate area where the script originated, expressed as a BCP47 region code.
# 4 - Density:
#		The approximate information density of characters in this script, based on comparison of bilingual texts.
# 5 - ID Usage:
#		The usage for IDs (tables 4-7) according to UAX #31.
#		For a description of values, see
#		http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers
# 6 - RTL:
#		YES if the script is RTL
#		Derived from whether the script contains RTL letters according to the Bidi_Class property
# 7 - LB letters:
#		YES if the major languages using the script allow linebreaks between letters (excluding hyphenation). 
#		Derived from LB property.
# 8 - Shaping Required:
#		YES if shaping is required for the major languages using that script for NFC text.
#			This includes not only ligation (and Indic conjuncts), Indic vowel splitting/reordering, and 
#			Arabic-style contextual shaping, but also cases where NSM placement is required, like Thai.
#		MIN if NSM placement is sufficient, not the more complex shaping.
#			The NSM placement may only be necessary for some major languages using the script.
# 9 - Input Method Engine Required:
#		YES if the major languages using the script require IMEs.
#		In particular, users (of languages for that script) would be accustomed to using IMEs (such as Japanese)
#		and typical commercial products for those languages would need IME support in order to be competitive.
# 10- Cased
#		YES if in modern (or most recent) usage case distinctions are customary.
#
# Sometimes a script is included here before it is added in the Unicode Standard.
# Such scripts are marked with a "provisional" comment.
#
# Note: For the most likely language for each script, see 
#		http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/likely_subtags.html
