				#	The following tailoring is an adjustment of the DUCET collation
				#	order for ANUSVARA, CANDRABINDU, and VISARGA. Instead of being
				#	sorted with secondary weights, they are collated on primary level
				#	before the independent vowels. CANDRABINDU is secondary different
				#	from ANUSVARA. This gives a sort order very close to the referenced
				#	dictionaries. The sort order in the dictionaries, which by the way
				#	are not exactly the same, require quite extensive tailoring.
