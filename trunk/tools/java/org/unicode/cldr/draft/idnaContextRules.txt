# IDNA CONTEXT RULES (including BIDI)
# Mark Davis
# $Date$
# Provides a table-based mechanism for determining whether a label is a U-Label or not.

# For testing, this turns on a Verbose mode, that displays the resolved sets and rules.

VERBOSE:true

# If any of the following regex expressions is found in the label, then the label is not a valid U-Label.
# These rules provide a machine-readable way to test that. This is intended for a reference (test) version;
# implementations would typically use hand-coded versions that would be much more optimized.
# The context rules are derived from http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idnabis-tables-05#appendix-A
# However, they do contain quite a number of corrections and proposed changes.

# FILE FORMAT

# Everything at and after # is a comment, and ignored.
# Blank lines are ignored.
# Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
# There are 3 kinds of lines: titles, rules and variable definitions

# A variable is defined with a line of the form $X = <unicodeSet>
# They are a single unicodeSet (character range) according to http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/
# These variables are substituted in the rules before evaluation

# Rules have the following formats:
# <before>; <at>; <result>
# <before> ; <result>
# Key:
#   <before> and <at> are both regex expressions
#   <result> is either "fail" or "next"
# Everything other kind of line is an error

# A title is of the form "Title: ...". It is just informational, but allows the test to show why a character causes a failure.

# Function
# Logically, a label is processed by iterating through its character positions
# In each iteration, each rule is checked.
# If <before> and <at> both match, then the result is applied as follows:
#   fail: stop, the label is invalid
#   next: skip to the next rule that has a "next" result (skipping any "fail" or "next2" results)
#   next2: skip to the next rule that has a "next" or "next2" result (skipping any "fail" results)
# If the processing reaches the end of the string, then the label is valid.

# The regex expressions use Java / Perl syntax, with Unicode properties. 
# If the regex does not support Unicode Properties (the latest version!), then explicit ranges can be substituted.
# For example, for [:bc=nsm:], using the set on http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:bc=nsm:]
# Interior spaces are ignored, and may be used for readability.

# The expressions are limited to a basic format which should work in any regex engine (perhaps with some syntax tweeks).
# In particular, the <before> and <at> split is used to avoid lookbehind, which can vary in results depending on regex engines.
# <before> is matched before the current position. Logically, it is equivalent to matching label[0,n] against /.*<before>/
# <at> is matched at the current position. Logically, it is equivalent to matching label[n,end] against /<at>.*/
